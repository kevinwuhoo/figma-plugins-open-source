Project Ideation and Brainstorming\n\nWireframe comes with collaboration in mind. Also, you can invite your co-worker on Figma and together in real-time design the user flow for your next project.\n\n2. User flows and Wireframes Graphics\n \nThe wireframe has over 350+ custom build graphics/cards to use, which covers most the web and mobile elements, interactions, and usage cases.\n\n3. No other skills and resources required\n\nThe wireframe is great and easy to use since you don't need to upload or use any other resources on Figma.\n\nHere we launch our first beta with some functionality for testing and feedback purposes. We improve day by day and give you the best version of our product so you can plan products better and better.\n\nDevices:\n- Web\n- Mobile\n- Tablet\n\nKits:\n- User Flow Kit by Greg Dlubacz\n- Random Colored Kit\n- Mobile Dark Kit","version":"7","icon_path":"plugins/742764242781786818/712/7eb2cd85-a2ab-4de0-9c87-3754be2df8cf-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/742764242781786818/712/7eb2cd85-a2ab-4de0-9c87-3754be2df8cf-cover","code_path":"plugins/742764242781786818/5736/f625f699-a9f3-4cf6-b247-c80c03ba9a63-code","resource_staging_signature":"f625f699-a9f3-4cf6-b247-c80c03ba9a63","manifest":{"id":"742764242781786818","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Wireframe"},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-05-11T15:59:54.462Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/742764242781786818/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/742764242781786818/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/742764242781786818/code"}},"creator":{"id":"692268974545161616","handle":"Manthankumar Satani","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/0520edbe-2011-4139-b141-522fc2647c95"},"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"731312569747199418","created_at":"2019-07-12T00:55:03.757Z","current_plugin_version_id":"3246","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://github.com/kawamurakazushi/figma-map-maker","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-07-12T00:55:03.757Z","install_count":56332,"like_count":232,"view_count":511069,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"945305","realtime_token":"/plugin-731312569747199418:1602563536:0:3c391768e0b2daa89b4e7ec69b036ef75aa93793","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/731312569747199418/thumbnail","install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"945305","user_id":"654582605227520693","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Tokyo, Japan","profile_handle":"kawamurakazushi","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:41.567Z","follower_count":2,"following_count":0,"name":"Kazushi Kawamura","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/81792db8-5182-4fd0-b114-613e8971c173","img_urls":{"120_120":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/06f20d5a-1d25-4652-9ae2-6f1b25ce60e9","500_500":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/81792db8-5182-4fd0-b114-613e8971c173"},"current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"9","plugin_id":"731312569747199418","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"3246":{"id":"3246","plugin_id":"731312569747199418","name":"Map Maker","description":"Map Maker allows you to make a customized map blazing fast.\nIt currently supports Google Maps and Mapbox. \n\nWe are planing to support other map hosting service as well.\n\n■ Easy To Use\n\nSelect any layer including Rectangle, Ellipse or even Polygon, and run Map Maker.\n\n■ Fully Customizable\n\nThese are the options you have to customize your Map!\n\n[Google Maps]\n1.

a URL you want to import\n\n* Why? *\n\n- Easily import real live site styles for a starting point for designs and prototypes\n- Quickly turn real site components into design components\n- Easy import from storybook, etc\n\n* Limitations *\n\nImporting HTML layers to Figma is a best-effort process. Even getting 90% there can save you a ton of time, only having to clean up a few things.\n\nA few known limitations:\n\n- not all element types are supported (e.g. iframe, pseudoelements)\n- not all CSS properties are supported or fully supported\n- not all types of media are supported (video, animated gifs, etc)\n- all fonts have to be uploaded to Figma or a best effort fallback will be used\n\nIf you find any issues or have feedback at all please make an issue or send a pull request for an improvement!\n\n* Chrome extension *\n\nWant to capture a page that you need to navigate to or is behind an auth wall?

Easily render Figma frames into real-life product mockups with a click of a button. More items are added to our ever-growing library every day.\n\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlfhPeAvK4Q\n\nHow to use:\n1. Follow the on-screen guide and create a secret API key on Artboard Studio.\n2. Paste your secret API key into the plugin window, save and start adding mockup items right into your current Figma file.\n3. All imported items are fully layered and customizable.\n4. Items that have renderable labels come with relevant frames. Copy and paste your designs into those frames, make sure the frame is selected and click Render Selected Frame.\n5. You can resize frames and mockup items, it will still work as long as you keep the aspect ratio.\n6. To unlock access to our premium items, subscribe to one of our premium plans. It will automatically unlock all items next time you use the Artboard Studio plugin in Figma.\n7. Use the menus on the top of the items to search and filter items based on name, viewpoint, and category.\n8. Happy Designing 😉\n\nRoad map:\n1. Enabling \"Quick Render\" for Figma browser (due to an unknown bug it currently only works on the the desktop version of Figma)\n2. Ability to assign your current frames to Artboard Studio mockup items.\n3. Automatically render frame changes into mockup items (we are waiting for Figma team to release long-running plugins and events for plugins)\n4. Adding more items every day will never leave our road map, check back every day to see new items fresh out of the oven 😋","version":"15","icon_path":"plugins/750673765607708804/1334/ba469d4e-24b6-4b14-aa91-62bb5e7b3311-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/750673765607708804/1334/ba469d4e-24b6-4b14-aa91-62bb5e7b3311-cover","code_path":"plugins/750673765607708804/4262/42b75119-9720-416b-8b09-d012e0373bd1-code","resource_staging_signature":"42b75119-9720-416b-8b09-d012e0373bd1","manifest":{"id":"750673765607708804","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","menu":[{"name":"Add Mockup Item","command":"item"}],"name":"Artboard Studio Mockups"},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-03-18T09:45:25.825Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/750673765607708804/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/750673765607708804/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/750673765607708804/code"}},"creator":{"id":"396749021265954175","handle":"Artboard Studio","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/a8af8f63-53db-476f-940c-9d4339c68b56"},"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"735072959812183643","created_at":"2019-07-22T09:57:30.610Z","current_plugin_version_id":"1228","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"jachui@microsoft.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-07-22T09:57:30.610Z","install_count":34457,"like_count":239,"view_count":342991,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"202936","realtime_token":"/plugin-735072959812183643:1602563536:0:68ce4ae75a12fe89cd54da2dd3b65591d95a94f8","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/735072959812183643/thumbnail","install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"202936","user_id":"479424971820437462","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Bellevue, WA","profile_handle":"jackie","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:48.449Z","follower_count":14,"following_count":0,"name":"Jackie Chui","img_url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7802edda936877edadf42595ab6d71c0?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_j_v2.png","img_urls":{"120_120":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7802edda936877edadf42595ab6d71c0?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_j_v2.png"},"current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"53","plugin_id":"735072959812183643","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"1228":{"id":"1228","plugin_id":"735072959812183643","name":"Find and Replace","description":"Search for texts on your page and replace them just like a text editor.\n\nYou can search for objects on your page by either text content or layer name.
