Click on the icon or drag and drop it into your design. Change the format between glyph or SVG by clicking on the settings menu. You can also adjust the icon size to scale as needed. When using glyphs make sure the selected font is downloaded and installed in Figma.</p><p><br></p><p>- Creating Text and Image Content: Navigate to My Content, click Create New and select content type.

Just select the elements you want to send to other people and tick the checkbox.\n\nHow to use?\n\nFirst of all, open the \"Figma Chat\" plugin inside your file.\nThe plugin generates a random room name and a secret key. These two strings are available to all editors inside the file.\n\nThe room name: This string is used to let the server know where to send the messages to.\nThe secret key: This string is used to en- and decrypt all messages.\n\nThe plugin handles all the stuff for you!\n\nAt the top of the plugin you can enter the user list, minimize the chat and access the \"Settings\" page and set a username, the color and if you want a custom server (https://github.com/ph1p/figma-chat-server). \n\nAn important function is to send your current selection. You can easily do this by selecting one or more element and clicking the checkbox that appears next to the chat bar.\n\n---\n\nAlways note: All messages are encrypted and can only be read by people who are able to run plugins inside your file.\nFeel free to write me if you have any problem or feedback (:\nPlease use the GitHub Issues (https://github.com/ph1p/figma-chat/issues) or follow me on twitter and write me a DM @phlp_","version":"34","icon_path":"plugins/742073255743594050/6059/9f878542-9889-4654-8b55-cbb5c10132d5-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/742073255743594050/6059/9f878542-9889-4654-8b55-cbb5c10132d5-cover","code_path":"plugins/742073255743594050/8178/aaa5a94b-43d0-4769-a0a6-2308a3572b79-code","resource_staging_signature":"aaa5a94b-43d0-4769-a0a6-2308a3572b79","manifest":{"id":"742073255743594050","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Figma Chat","relaunchButtons":[{"name":"Open Figma-Chat","command":"open"},{"name":"Send selection to chat","command":"relaunch","multipleSelection":true}],"enableProposedApi":false},"release_notes":"Check broken message history and avoid emptying screen.","created_at":"2020-08-20T17:49:16.749Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/742073255743594050/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/742073255743594050/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/742073255743594050/code"}},"creator":{"id":"634322407012367232","handle":"Phil (ph1p)","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/91ec5de5-b211-49e4-ab44-28173fd5e074"},"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"750673765607708804","created_at":"2019-09-03T11:09:32.562Z","current_plugin_version_id":"11598","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"info@artboard.studio","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-10-18T22:46:56.328Z","install_count":40373,"like_count":500,"view_count":730268,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"86679","comments_setting":null,"realtime_token":"/plugin-750673765607708804:1607402363:0:054f735a5e00a4bf4449d4f39743e76d5b5ce976","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/750673765607708804/thumbnail","install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"86679","user_id":"396749021265954175","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"İstanbul","profile_handle":"artboardstudio","public_at":"2019-10-23T07:19:57.356Z","follower_count":61,"following_count":0,"name":"Artboard Studio","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/a8af8f63-53db-476f-940c-9d4339c68b56","img_urls":{"120_120":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/a8af8f63-53db-476f-940c-9d4339c68b56","500_500":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/92c09c7a-27c7-449d-b96e-08be0c72ad3d"},"current_user_is_following":null,"is_restricted_by_current_user":null},"roles":{"id":"350","plugin_id":"750673765607708804","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"11598":{"id":"11598","plugin_id":"750673765607708804","name":"Artboard Studio Mockups","description":"<p>Create mockups in Figma easily by getting access to thousands of world-class quality Artboard Studio mockup items right inside your Figma files.

makes it easy to check the contrast ratios of colors as you work. Select a layer and Contrast will immediately look for the color directly behind your selection and serve up the contrast ratio along with passing and failing levels from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). If Contrast cannot find the background color, add another layer to your selection, and Contrast will compare them both.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you looking to give everything a once-over before finishing? Scan entire pages to generate a report of all text-based contrast issues. Step through them and fix issues as needed.</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Select elements to automatically find the color behind them</li><li>Scan entire pages to see all text-layer color issues</li><li>Works on any element, not just text</li><li>Extremely fast and responsive—keep it open as you work</li><li>Supports image and gradient backgrounds with Smart Sampling</li><li>Supports solid, transparent, blended fills, layered fills, and backgrounds</li><li>Live updates as you change the color, opacity, or blend of the selected element</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Smart Sampling</h2><p>Contrast can compare an element’s color with the colors it finds in gradients and images in the background. It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.</p><p><br></p><h2>Bugs</h2><p>If you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know! Send us an example test case in Figma along with a short description of what you were expecting, and we’ll have a look.</p><p><br></p><h2>Known Issues</h2><ul><li>Element strokes are not yet supported</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Smart Sampling Technique</h2><p>Contrast uses <a href=\"https://github.com/leeoniya/RgbQuant.js/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">RGBQuant</a> to analyze the selection of pixels behind an element. It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.</p><p><br></p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Contrast was made by the Maark design team.</p>","version":"15","icon_path":"plugins/748533339900865323/5507/c6019308-ca2d-457e-a0bc-09bb7e13bed1-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/748533339900865323/5046/4d4c1530-f0b6-4242-9c58-24cc30b92dc4-cover","code_path":"plugins/748533339900865323/10100/94405a84-44e4-41d0-81a6-f55e6f9cba35-code","resource_staging_signature":"94405a84-44e4-41d0-81a6-f55e6f9cba35","manifest":{"id":"748533339900865323","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"Contrast"},"release_notes":"Updated icon.","created_at":"2020-10-29T15:50:01.463Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/748533339900865323/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/748533339900865323/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/748533339900865323/code"}},"creator":{"id":"667353512563944090","handle":"Alex Carr","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/6947386b-08a9-48e9-9ac1-c11f8a686ae8"},"current_user_liked":null}]},"pagination":{"next_page":"https://www.figma.com/api/plugins/browse?sort_by=installs&tag=&sort_order=desc&pagination_direction=next&column_cursor=34358&id_cursor=748533339900865323&page_size=50"}}
