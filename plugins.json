Use it for color, text and effect styles.\n\nHow does it work?\nThemer associates published styles with a theme name. When you have multiple themes, Themer will swap styles that match across themes: which means you need two styles with the same names in each theme.\n\nIn order for Themer to be used across your team, generic information about your styles is shared on a external service (jsonbin.io). You will need an account with an API key to get started (You can easily sign in with Google, GutHub or Twitter).\n\nWatch the setup video on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SkksBy3Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n1. Insert your API key from JSONbin\n\n2. Create your first theme, giving it a unique name, and then choose where you want to pull the styles from (all local styles, styles used on the page, or a selection).\n\n*Tip*: If all of your styles exist within one document, you can also prefix your style names with 'theme1/' or 'theme2/' and set Themer to generate multiuple themes at once.\n\n3. With your themes created, you can now apply them to a selection or the entire page. Remember, your design must make use of the same styles from one of the themes to work.\n\nPrivacy:\nThemer stores information about your styles at a service external to Figma. For each theme, we store the name of the theme, the name of the style, the type of style (color, text, effect), and a unique key required to import your styles into a document from your team library. No other data from your file is sent to Jsonbin. Your unique API key is storred locally as well, so if you use Themer across devices, between team members, or between Figma Desktop and Figma in the browser, you will need to re-enter your API key and your Bin URL so that everyone/everywhere has access to the same list of Themes.\n\nRemember to publish your styles before creating a Theme :)\n\nRoadmap:\n• Currently Themer does not yet work text boxes which contan multiple text styles, the plan is to enable this in the near future","version":"10","icon_path":"plugins/731176732337510831/1/02561dbb-652f-4792-be60-049df05cd7d3-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/731176732337510831/1925/9fce78d7-3f37-4034-9e6a-5b6e0c826236-cover","code_path":"plugins/731176732337510831/5615/2d080c0f-ce96-49a4-8f92-6d02bf794787-code","resource_staging_signature":"2d080c0f-ce96-49a4-8f92-6d02bf794787","manifest":{"id":"731176732337510831","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Themer"},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-05-07T01:19:38.961Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/731176732337510831/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/731176732337510831/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/731176732337510831/code"}},"creator":{"id":"389280060724156709","handle":"Tom Lowry","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/8ecd165d-35c1-4b1e-a353-0d97280df139"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"739922281164562258","created_at":"2019-08-04T19:06:58.918Z","current_plugin_version_id":"4306","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"twitter.com/nitinrgupta","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-08-04T19:06:58.918Z","install_count":47503,"like_count":576,"view_count":762456,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"21180","realtime_token":"/plugin-739922281164562258:1598180360:0:e47b2de839859eef5d5431d57a5fd12e915e2d96","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/739922281164562258/thumbnail","tags":["font","fontpicker","picker"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"21180","user_id":"327145045590620318","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Bangalore, India","profile_handle":"nitin","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:48.380Z","follower_count":5,"following_count":5,"name":"Nitin Gupta","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/9f33d741-f6ca-43a1-8954-778cedfaccbd","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"111","plugin_id":"739922281164562258","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"4306":{"id":"4306","plugin_id":"739922281164562258","name":"Better Font Picker","description":"Well...

Content Reel lets you create custom content and share it with other Figma users. Collaboration has never been easier! \n\n[ Content Library ]\n\nBrowse or search the Content Library to find published collections of text strings, images and icons. Not finding what you need? No problem, create your own text and image content.\n\n[ My Content ]\n\nCreate text categories and populate them with your own text strings. You can also upload up to 20 PNGs or JPEGs to create image content. As a Content Creator you may choose to share it publicly in the Content Library or keep it private. When you create content it is automatically pinned to Home Screen for quick access (signed in users only).\n\n[ Customize Your Home Screen ]\n\nOptimize your workflow by pinning content that you use most to your home screen. Apply 1-click access to any content type with the switch of a toggle (signed in users only).\n\nHow to use Content Reel:\n\n- Find Content: Access content from your Home Screen or navigate to Content Library to search or browse for content.\n\n- Applying Text Content: Select one or more text layers in your design to apply strings individually or apply all. Use the original order provided or choose an order from the drop down menu.\n\n- Applying Image Content:  Select one or more image layers or frames in your design, then apply the images individually or apply all in random order.                \n\n- Applying Icon Content: Browse the collection or use the search bar to find an icon. Click on the icon or drag and drop it into your design. Change the format between glyph or SVG by clicking on the settings menu. You can also adjust the icon size to scale as needed. When using glyphs make sure the selected font is downloaded and installed in Figma.  \n\n- Creating Text and Image Content: Navigate to My Content, click Create New and select content type. Provide a Title that is relevant to your content. Set your content to Public or Private. See terms and conditions.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nGot more ideas?

All based on WCAG guidelines.\n​\nHow it works\nContrast Checker\nWe think about our color contrast checker like a stack of pancakes, and there are a few combos you can use when checking contrast...\n​\n• Shape Layer + Shape Layer\n• Text Layer + Shape Layer\n• Text Layer + Text Layer (Odd combo though, tbh)\n• Component or Instance (this checks against the #frame)\n• Single Layer (this checks against the #frame)\n​\nTo run the contrast check...\n1. Select one of the options above\n2. Run the check from the plugin menu by going to Plugins > Stark > Contrast Checker.\n​\nSomething to note:\nWant to check contrast on an opaque layer? No problem! Turn the fill, text or layer opacity of your foreground element to `< 100%`, and voila. Opaque and bake! \n​\nBut don't try to run the checker on any gradients or imagery — it won't work as we don't allow it right now. Why? Well, you get into finicky territory because you can't guarantee with certainty the RGB/HEX/etc. value so your ratio may actually be a false positive. Once we have the perfect solution, we’ll deliver.\n​\nColorblind Simulator\nThe colorblind simulator allows you to simulate what your designs would look like for individuals with various types of colorblindness. While your designs may pass contrast as is (Great job!), it actually may look completely different and have drastically different contrast depending on the colorblindness.\n​\nTo run the simulator…\n1. Select a #frame\n2. Run the simulation from the plugin menu by going to Plugins > Stark > Colorblind Simulator\n3.

(Deuteranomaly)\n      • Blue-blind (Tritanopia)\n      • Blue-weak (Tritanomaly)\n      • Monochromacy (Achromatopsia)\n      • Blue Cone Monochromacy (Achromatomaly)\n\nThis can be really helpful if you want to convert some mockups into ‘Greyscale’ for prototyping or user testing.","version":"1","icon_path":"plugins/735658738614175372/127/66858688-db5a-4b35-8a6e-0d417b03d059-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/735658738614175372/127/66858688-db5a-4b35-8a6e-0d417b03d059-cover","code_path":"plugins/735658738614175372/127/66858688-db5a-4b35-8a6e-0d417b03d059-code","resource_staging_signature":"66858688-db5a-4b35-8a6e-0d417b03d059","manifest":{"id":"735658738614175372","ui":"decoder.html","api":"0.6.0","main":"code.js","menu":[{"name":"Greyscale","command":"Greyscale"},{"name":"Invert","command":"Invert"},{"name":"Sepia","command":"Sepia"},{"separator":true},{"menu":[{"name":"Red-blind","command":"Protanopia"},{"name":"Red-weak","command":"Protanomaly"},{"name":"Green-blind","command":"Deuteranopia"},{"name":"Green-weak","command":"Deuteranomaly"},{"name":"Blue-blind","command":"Tritanopia"},{"name":"Blue-weak","command":"Tritanomaly"},{"name":"Monochromacy","command":"Achromatopsia"},{"name":"Blue

Select the frame with all the components you'd like to swap.\n2. Select the theme you'd like to switch to in the \"Swap\" tab. \n3. Select \"Swap Theme\".\nNote:  The themes must be present in the file to switch themes.\nTo relink colors, the layers must have the same name as their desired color, so the side bar background layer would need to be named ---sideBar.background. This is what enables Kaleidocode to go find the color style for the desired theme and relink it.\n\nCreate\n1. To create a custom theme, paste in the JSON for your theme into the text box. \n2. Select \"Create Custom Styles\"\nNote: this should match the formatting for all other VS Code color themes, where the colors are defined \"activityBar.background\": \"#fafafa\"\n3. Your custom color guide is now available on your canvas and the color styles for each color have been added to your library.\n\n————————————\n👩‍💻 About\n————————————\n\nWe created Kaleidocode because we saw a need to easily and quickly import and generate color themes from VS Code to Figma. Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.\n\nKaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.","version":"9","icon_path":"plugins/736060893363678891/154/63d73c1b-b0bd-4f64-b2fb-a99ae36af040-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/736060893363678891/145/01fe16fd-91df-4087-bb11-80e7f3be08e7-cover","code_path":"plugins/736060893363678891/301/c5f99277-9f6f-4015-9662-aef28c866772-code","resource_staging_signature":"c5f99277-9f6f-4015-9662-aef28c866772","manifest":{"id":"736060893363678891","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"Kaleidocode"},"release_notes":"- Updated the way color guide groups labels are created\n- When creating color guides we now zoom them into view\n- Updated the Figma api to v1.0.0","created_at":"2019-08-02T23:58:07.001Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/736060893363678891/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/736060893363678891/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/736060893363678891/code"}},"creator":{"id":"363421902915300361","handle":"Miguel Solorio","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/172abf97-1b8a-4be6-8355-bdff2332d6c8"},"author_org":{"id":"588096576863690753","name":"Microsoft"},"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"731841207668879837","created_at":"2019-07-13T11:55:40.855Z","current_plugin_version_id":"254","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"info@mattdesl.studio","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-07-13T11:55:40.855Z","install_count":65533,"like_count":299,"view_count":537996,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"1349726","realtime_token":"/plugin-731841207668879837:1598180360:0:d5c35a995a3293ee1d240cd71dd097ce0d244e89","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/731841207668879837/thumbnail","tags":["color","color_palette","generative","images","palette"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"1349726","user_id":"694658998464996400","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"London, UK","profile_handle":"mattdesl","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:41.481Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":0,"name":"Matt DesLauriers","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/eba079de-ff85-4529-bd5b-67cce5f51da6","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"18","plugin_id":"731841207668879837","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"254":{"id":"254","plugin_id":"731841207668879837","name":"Image Palette","description":"Extracts a colour palette of 5 different colours from the selected images.\n\nNote: This uses a median cut algorithm, which roughly approximates the most prominent different colours in the image.

is a small tool that will help you automatically apply padding to frames. A few options will also be available to you to optimize how Paddet updates your paddings. The last used settings are saved for each frame so you can easily let paddy automagically update your paddings on the fly without having to check your settings again.\n\nFAQ\n* Can I use it on component instances?\nYes you can! Do keep in mind it will firstly apply the padding to your master component and update the selected instances afterwards. Another important note to mention is that whenever your master component updates all your instances will be affected as well, however paddy will not automatically update your instances for their respective content. If this is something you want you need to use the :paddet-autoupdate flag on the instance name\n\n* What does the :paddet-autoupdate flag do in the name of an instance?\nIf a component instance has this flag in it's name Paddet wil update the instance for it's content whenever Paddet is used on the master component.\n\n* What does using :paddet-ignore in my layer name do?\nThis flag will ensure Paddet does not take into account that layer when it is calculating the width and height of the current content. This is especially useful when you have a seperate layer for your background as you do not want this layer to be taken into account as actual content.\n\n* What does using :paddet-resize in my layer name do?\nUsing the resize flag will tell Paddet to resize it along with your frame.  As with the ignore flag, this is useful when you have a background layer.\n\n* Can I combine the ignore and resize flags?\nYes you can.\n\n* Will Paddet remember my settings?\nYes, whenever you update a frame with Paddet it will save your last used settings for that specific frame. This way you can use the \"Auto update padding\" option to easily re-update your paddings without having to open the complete plugin.","version":"11","icon_path":"plugins/734548932196004433/98/aadf04c2-0149-4c91-9a95-abdc07799f65-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/734548932196004433/332/2a792cb1-b76c-40e1-83a5-437b076cf905-cover","code_path":"plugins/734548932196004433/834/6711abda-8e00-498f-b99a-c23f862bb824-code","resource_staging_signature":"6711abda-8e00-498f-b99a-c23f862bb824","manifest":{"id":"734548932196004433","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/plugin.js","menu":[{"name":"Auto update padding","command":"auto-set-padding"},{"name":"Open paddet","command":""}],"name":"Paddet"},"release_notes":"v0.2.0\nImplemented independent paddings","created_at":"2019-08-24T10:08:58.118Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/734548932196004433/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/734548932196004433/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/734548932196004433/code"}},"creator":{"id":"383754125047657632","handle":"Liam Martens","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/b86d0720-9e9d-4575-b11e-920166073176"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"734492262527930956","created_at":"2019-07-20T19:30:01.590Z","current_plugin_version_id":"3264","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"singer.jordan@gmail.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-07-20T19:30:01.590Z","install_count":13183,"like_count":84,"view_count":105369,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"1609","realtime_token":"/plugin-734492262527930956:1598180360:0:4b0270a0f05e27b43bfb289829622dd4612d0524","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/734492262527930956/thumbnail","tags":["history","version"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"1609","user_id":null,"team_id":"577678921737103452","org_id":null,"location":"","profile_handle":"CashApp","public_at":"2020-01-31T20:53:58.134Z","follower_count":50,"following_count":0,"name":"Cash App","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/41db29be-8274-4f93-9d70-14c6c9e7f778","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"47","plugin_id":"734492262527930956","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"3264":{"id":"3264","plugin_id":"734492262527930956","name":"Time Machine","description":"Time Machine saves and organizes work that you want to look back on.

imports your design system code repository and lets you design with code components in Figma.\n\nWith the Interplay plugin you can browse all of your design system code components, add them to your design in Figma, edit their content and all of the Code Component properties.\n\nInterplay generates a Figma component on the fly and keeps it connected with the related code component so that your design is always in sync with your production code.\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nLive rendering on the canvas. You can now edit components that have already been added to the canvas.\n\nOn canvas editing. You can now edit content directly on the canvas. When you edit a text box on the canvas, the Code Component property will be updated automatically.\n\nOn canvas resizing. To resize a component, you can now resize it directly on the canvas in Figma. When you resize a component, Interplay renders the code component in a browser in the background, and translates that layout back into Figma.\n\nUI Improvements. We’ve made lots of UI updates to make it easier to browse components and edit properties\n\nQuick Start\n\n1. So that you can try out Interplay straight away, we’ve configured some open source libraries for you to get started including Reactstrap and Ant Design. Select a design system and start dragging components onto the canvas.\n\n2. To edit content and Code Component properties, select any component on the canvas and the plugin will display all of the the available code properties for the component.\n\nUsing your own design system in Figma with Interplay\n\nWe are gradually rolling out access to the Interplay CLI tool and Design System Manager which lets  can import your own design system to Interplay. We are gradually rolling out access to teams. \n\nSign up for updates from within the plugin or by going to

can choose to use a specific sheet in the workbook by naming the page in your Figma file similar to how you’d name a layer – e.g. Naming your page ‘Page 1 //Properties’ will use the sheet named ‘Properties’ from your Google Sheet. \n(This also works if you name a frame or group the name of the specific Sheet too.)\n\nIf you do not name your page accordingly, it will default to using the first Sheet in your Workbook\n\n--------\n\nUSING IMAGES \n\nTo dynamically set an image fill on your layer — make sure the value in your Google Sheet for a specific property is an image URL (it must end with ‘.jpg’, ‘.png’ or ‘.gif’). Then make sure you name a Vector/Shape layer with the appropriate name – e.g. ‘#image’\n\n--------\n\nMore details and documentation for advanced usage coming soon...","version":"10","icon_path":"plugins/735770583268406934/614/8ceb8669-360c-4a86-9031-8dba20d4cc75-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/735770583268406934/614/8ceb8669-360c-4a86-9031-8dba20d4cc75-cover","code_path":"plugins/735770583268406934/5398/372b92e4-77c0-4c58-b6d9-a9ed3766e1aa-code","resource_staging_signature":"372b92e4-77c0-4c58-b6d9-a9ed3766e1aa","manifest":{"id":"735770583268406934","ui":"build/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"build/plugin.js","name":"Google Sheets Sync","relaunchButtons":[{"name":"Open Google Sheets Sync","command":"open"},{"name":"Re-sync Google Sheets Data","command":"refetch"}]},"release_notes":"Fixed an issue where on launch, when it defaulted to 'Update current selection only' — it would actually sync the entire page.

This is done to maintain spacing for when the height of an element has changed in the instance, i.e. if you have text change from 1 line to 2. \n\nRequirements:\n\nMaster components are required to have a frame, the plugin looks for this. Within the frame you must have 2 elements; these are the ones that you'll fill up with content and will change from instance to instance. This usually is a \"header\" and \"body copy\" (see artwork picture above). \n\nThe frame must have the following settings:\n- Either contrained \"top and bottom\" or \"scale\" (vertical) \n\nThe top element must have the following settings:\n- Constrained to the top\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align top (for text)\n\nThe bottom element must have the following settings:\n-  Contrained to the bottom\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align bottom (for text)\n\nIf you've done this setup, open up the plugin modal, select the element or elements you want to resize and click \"run\". \n\nThe plugin will run it's magic. It will maintain the space between the two elements within the frame (in the example in the artwork, 20px). If you want to change the spacing, adjust the master, then select the elements and return the plugin. \n\nI will create an automatic resizer when figma allows for long lasting plugins. \n\nAny other feedback, feel free to email me at daniel_maddock@intuit.com","version":"4","icon_path":"plugins/734140091470043718/88/a4398762-af6a-4608-829f-224efce4b1bb-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/734140091470043718/88/a4398762-af6a-4608-829f-224efce4b1bb-cover","code_path":"plugins/734140091470043718/598/8fd4fbd9-74a5-4446-a3b0-e6fd8ea0c164-code","resource_staging_signature":"8fd4fbd9-74a5-4446-a3b0-e6fd8ea0c164","manifest":{"id":"734140091470043718","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code-primative.js","name":"Dynamic Component Resizer"},"release_notes":"Updated api version to 1.0.0","created_at":"2019-08-13T17:04:30.561Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/734140091470043718/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/734140091470043718/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/734140091470043718/code"}},"creator":{"id":"702939405071749209","handle":"Daniel Maddock","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/49c3acef-0afe-477a-a59b-d0ff51c9e5ed"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"744098704933821409","created_at":"2019-08-16T07:42:35.941Z","current_plugin_version_id":"746","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"support@iconscout.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-08-16T07:42:35.941Z","install_count":19057,"like_count":101,"view_count":225099,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"2032346","realtime_token":"/plugin-744098704933821409:1598180360:0:88d7f6603a8c558291cceff37685449d42056f74","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/744098704933821409/thumbnail","tags":["art","assets","clipart","icons","illustrations","images","lifestyle","photos","stock"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"2032346","user_id":"744098418490266411","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":null,"profile_handle":"iconscout","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:46.878Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":0,"name":"Iconscout","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/cbcd28b8-1969-4d82-8356-b4be7fe8a3e1","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"194","plugin_id":"744098704933821409","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"746":{"id":"746","plugin_id":"744098704933821409","name":"Iconscout","description":"Iconscout allows you to insert millions of high quality icons, illustrations and stock photos right into Figma.\n\nIt provides you an access to amazing features such as:\n1.

plugin is the best for creating beautiful user flow prototypes and basic structures in Figma so no other kits, files or skills required!\n\nDesign & developed by Deep Joshi and Manthankumar Satani\n\nIf a designer wants to simplify the process in the early stage of a project like planning and brainstorming then “Wireframe” Plugin plays a major role in this process and makes it easier because a designer should spend time on thinking awesome design ideas, not on the basics they already know.\n\nThe Wireframe has a list for Web and Mobile pre-designed wireframes(templates) divided into categories which can be added directly to Figma page by clicking on the frame.\n\nWe suggest to look at all the frames of the plugin and you will know which one you need for your current task after all your the designer.\n\nAll files are Figma Component (SVG) hence they are easily editable and the user can manage easily all wireframing and prototyping activities as per his/her needs.\n\nWhy “Wireframe Plugin” Useful for you and your team?\n\n1. Project Ideation and Brainstorming\n\nWireframe comes with collaboration in mind. Also, you can invite your co-worker on Figma and together in real-time design the user flow for your next project.\n\n2. User flows and Wireframes Graphics\n \nThe wireframe has over 350+ custom build graphics/cards to use, which covers most the web and mobile elements, interactions, and usage cases.\n\n3.

Generate utility palette: extracts the dominant color from an image, suggests high-contrast text colors, and includes additional complementary palette information.\n2. Smart populate: takes your selection and intelligently sets layer fills and text colors based on nearby images.\n\nGenerating a dominant color palette\n\n1. Select one or more layers in Figma that contain image fills. \n1. Run the plugin Menu > Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨  and your palette will be generated. \n\nNote: To prevent overlapping frames from appearing in your designs, align your images 500px apart.\n\nSmart populate\n\n1. Select any frame, component, or instance\n2. Menu > Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨\n3. Command + Shift + P to re-run\n\nHow does Smart Populate work?\n- If you selected one or more frames which contain an image, shapes, and text, the plugin will use the first image it finds to automatically fill the shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to have a high-contrast fill against that dominant color.\n- If you selected an image along with shapes and text layers, the plugin will use the selected image to populate selected shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to use the high-contrast fill color.\n- If you selected shapes and text, but no image, the plugin will traverse outwards in your frame until it finds an image fill. This image will will then be used to populate the shapes and text with the dominant color and high-contrast text colors.\n\nNote: This plugin supports both image fills and background fills, using the first valid fill it can find. As a result, a frame with a background fill that has children shape and text layers will populate successfully!\n\nSecret options: If you'd like to text layers to the dominant color rather than high-contrast color, simply include the text \"dominant\" anywhere in the layer name!\n \nThis plugin is open source, contributions welcome: https://github.com/brianlovin/figma-dominant-color-toolkit\n\nCredits\n\ncolor-thief (https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) for finding dominant colors and generating palettes","version":"7","icon_path":"plugins/744725347356614754/710/2d59f9c7-820e-4ef2-94bb-2dda1876411f-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/744725347356614754/730/fc522fba-c44e-45aa-90ad-1dabb704c830-cover","code_path":"plugins/744725347356614754/821/7d2b23f2-2fbb-40ca-9a37-a83d3164910a-code","resource_staging_signature":"7d2b23f2-2fbb-40ca-9a37-a83d3164910a","manifest":{"id":"744725347356614754","ui":"build/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"build/code.js","name":"Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨"},"release_notes":"Fixes a bug where the smart populate would sometimes look outside of a parent's outer selection befor hitting the page in order to find a source image.","created_at":"2019-08-23T14:56:22.880Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/744725347356614754/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/744725347356614754/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/744725347356614754/code"}},"creator":{"id":"331907918636453392","handle":"Brian Lovin","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/e3a39810-b382-401c-96ff-b9043c424994"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"734693888346260052","created_at":"2019-07-21T08:51:12.931Z","current_plugin_version_id":"2829","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"sondre@kvam.io","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-07-21T08:51:12.931Z","install_count":31755,"like_count":251,"view_count":744988,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"503922","realtime_token":"/plugin-734693888346260052:1598180360:0:813c53adadb6ac1bbaa4583742304ad73bc21598","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/734693888346260052/thumbnail","tags":["accessibility","color"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"503922","user_id":"582151016051772491","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Trondheim, Norway","profile_handle":"kvam","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:41.816Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":1,"name":"Sondre Kvam","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/b6daf25a-4b6d-4c39-b8b8-886714d672ed","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"129","plugin_id":"734693888346260052","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"2829":{"id":"2829","plugin_id":"734693888346260052","name":"Able – Friction free accessibility","description":"Able makes accessibility easy, while looking and feeling like Figma! \nAdd color contrast and color blindness to your workflow with as little effort as possible.

Hence, Fix San Francisco is here to automate this process for you ♥\n\nInspired by Sketch-SF-UI-Font-Fixer.","version":"3","icon_path":"plugins/742063658553085504/552/50b4eedb-a175-4173-b95f-87f3189f96c1-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/742063658553085504/552/50b4eedb-a175-4173-b95f-87f3189f96c1-cover","code_path":"plugins/742063658553085504/8186/39468a9c-cf76-4375-b76e-22f66e192250-code","resource_staging_signature":"39468a9c-cf76-4375-b76e-22f66e192250","manifest":{"id":"742063658553085504","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Fix San Francisco"},"release_notes":"Added support for texts with mixed properties.","created_at":"2020-08-21T06:44:04.664Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/742063658553085504/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/742063658553085504/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/742063658553085504/code"}},"creator":{"id":"362980542249759294","handle":"Charlie Chao","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/e04cf2d9-f37f-44bd-875e-725199a95233"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"742549221432366731","created_at":"2019-08-12T01:05:30.287Z","current_plugin_version_id":"1399","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"dustin@goodmake.co","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-08-12T01:05:30.287Z","install_count":46081,"like_count":169,"view_count":334088,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"1206807","realtime_token":"/plugin-742549221432366731:1598180360:0:458c24a73f0d5646d5177221bacdd70dfec746b4","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/742549221432366731/thumbnail","tags":["color","colormind","generative","machine_learning","palettes"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"1206807","user_id":"683018450090042041","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Portland, OR","profile_handle":"dustin","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:49.557Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":0,"name":"Dustin Mierau","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/be50745c-1160-40bb-9cc2-308e978202fb","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"169","plugin_id":"742549221432366731","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"1399":{"id":"1399","plugin_id":"742549221432366731","name":"Palette","description":"Palette helps you create the perfect color palette through machine learning from Colormind.\n\nUsage\n\nWhen you open Palette it will detect which shapes you have selected and use their fill colors (up to 5) or an image fill to seed your new color palette.\n\nColor palettes are generated automatically using machine intelligence.

No exports, copying and pasting files, no code cleaning or additional optimizations. \n\nFor developers: Imagine that you receive a bunch of icons from your fellow designer. You have to extract needed data from all those SVG files... It's time consuming... Forget about it. Now you can easily export all icons data to a JSON file with one click! If you have a custom Icon component in React, Angular or Vue — that's all you need.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Create frames / components / instances with unique names (plugin seeks for every frame / components / instances in a current page)\n2. Draw icons or paste them from your favorite tool (like IconJar)\n3. Flatten them (if they are not already)\n4. Use the plugin to create a JSON with needed data\n5. Use data with your custom Icon component\n6. 🎉\n\nTip! Hidden frames, components or instances are skipped by the plugin\n\n=========================\nCustom components & examples:\n1.

The Golden Ratio is a fantastic way to make harmonious layouts which look & feel awesome. The plugin calculates the sizes and position of your selected items automatically!\n\nYou can:\n\n- Align your selection between the two parts of the Golden Ratio (Major & Minor)\n- Resize and align your selection to match the Major Golden Ratio part\n- Round all size / position changes by multiplier of 8\n\n—\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. Select a layer (it can be anything like Rectangles, Images, Text, Groups, Components, ...). Even multiple layers are supported\n2. Right Click > Plugins > \"Golden Ratio Align & Resize\"\n3. Select one of the four methods\n\n—\n\nFAQ\n\n1. What does the option \"Round by 8px\" does?\n\nIt rounds the automatically generated new position / size of your selection to the nearest multiplier of 8. This can be useful, if you work in the 8px Grid. E.g.: 90px -> 92px, 87px -> 88px, etc...\n\n2. What does the option \"Rotate direction\" does?\n\nIt rotates the direction to either vertical or horizontal. The default setting is based on the width of your selection's parent frame.

Simple right-click on your frame, go to Plugins, Status, and select your desired status.\n\nSome tips:\n- You can select multiple frames at once. Each frame will get its own status badge.\n- Use the keyboard shortcut to quickly set a status: hit `cmd /` in Mac and `ctrl /` on Windows, type a Status (e.g. “Done”) and hit return.\n- Status for Figma is not limited to frames. It works with any object you can select.\n- You can optionally automatically group the selected element and status badge, so they can be moved around easily (see the plugin settings)\n\nStatus for Figma is open source.

To create a Stack, select either a single Frame or Component, or two or more layers, and choose ‘Create/Edit Stack’. When you make a change within a Stack, choose ’Update Selected Stacks’ or ‘Update All Stacks’ to update the layout. Pro tip: bind these to a keyboard shortcut to speed up your workflow.\n\nStack parameters:\n* Spacing: The amount of space separating layers.\n* Direction: Whether layers should be stacked horizontally or vertically.\n* Alignment: Whether layers should be aligned to the top, middle or bottom of their parent Frame or Component. This is optional, so layers can maintain their original alignment.\n* Anchoring: The corner to which the parent container resizes relative to.\n\nOther notes:\n* Stacks can be nested inside of other Stacks.\n* Stacks applied to Components also affect their instances.

Select all the layers you want to be changed. If there is a Group or Frame within the selection, plugin will find every unlocked visible text layer inside of the selection. \n\n2. Call the plugin. List of founded text layers would be shown, so you can change all of them in one run. Navigate between fields with Tab / Shift+Tab. \n\nYou also can paste multiple lines at once. Hold Shift while pasting, and every new line from copied text would be pasted into it's own field.\n\n3. Click \"Change\" or press Enter. All changes would be applied. Mixed formatting for the layers that have been changed will be dropped.\n\nAdded in version 4:\n• Text layer coresponding with the currently active input now selected on canvas, so you can see more clearly which layer you will be changing.\n• Input orders now depends on position and nesting of the layers. If top leftmost object among selected id group all text layers inside of it will be placed in list of inputs first, and so on.\n• Now you can copy multiple layers from inputs. When you press Cmd+Shift+C texts from currently selected input and all inputs down from it will be copied to clipboard with new lines as a delimiters. \n• Now tabs also works as a delimiters with multiline paste.

Sure, until you need to design an entire data table, or a dozen different cards of the same variety, at which point you’ll be wishing for an easier way to go about it. Luckily, now there is! This plugin allows you to effortlessly pull text and images from an Airtable database and inject them straight into your Figma components. Using the plugin is child’s play. First, you build your component in Figma, business as usual. Then, you load up the Airtable 2 Figma plugin, and map the Airtable data fields to the right layers in Figma. Finally, choose the layout you want your component to be laid out as and voilà, you just saved yourself a couple hundred clicks! You now have a nice set of data directly inserted  into your designs. Find out more at: https://figma.bothrs.com\n\nTake a gander at the data types we can import directly from Airtable into Figma:\n\n1. Single line text\n2. Long text\n3. Phone number\n4. Email\n5. Numeric\n6. Image\n\nHere’s a sample database (about cats) for you to experiment with: https://airtable.com/shr0hyEnBae0AKKfQ\n\nNext, follow these steps, or watch a tutorial video over at https://figma.bothrs.com\n\n1. Go to https://airtable.com  and build or select your own table\n2. In your Airtable of choice, click ‘Share’\n3. Scroll down and click ‘Create a shared view’\n4. Click ‘Share the current view’\n5. Next, click ‘Create a shareable grid view’.\n6. Then, copy the link and paste it in the plugin window.\n7. Assign Airtable columns to text nodes or images.\n8. Select the view you want to use and configure the rest\n9. Done! For every row in your table, an instance will be created.\n\nSounds pretty cool, right?\n\nMissing a particular feature?

Set direction to horizontal and adjust padding/alignment to your liking. You can change the order by moving layers up and down in the layers sidebar. \n4. With the frame selected, set Height to ‘Resize To Fit’ in AutoLayout which will automatically resize the frame when the text field gets longer\n5. Duplicate the frame a few times below to create a list of todos\n6. Wrap all todo items in a frame and enable AutoLayout, set the direction to vertical. You can adjust spacing between the items.\n7. Try adding a linebreak in one of the todo items to make it larger. The items below will automatically move down to make room.\n\nThe layout of the frame will update every second if either a child layer or the frame itself is selected.

Select a layer and Contrast will immediately look for the color directly behind your selection and serve up the contrast ratio along with passing and failing levels from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). If Contrast cannot find the background color, add another layer to your selection, and Contrast will compare them both.\n\nAre you looking to give everything a once-over before finishing? Scan entire pages to generate a report of all text-based contrast issues. Step through them and fix issues as needed.\n\n* Select elements to automatically find the color behind them\n* Scan entire pages to see all text-layer color issues\n* Works on any element, not just text\n* Extremely fast and responsive—keep it open as you work\n* Supports image and gradient backgrounds with Smart Sampling\n* Supports solid, transparent, blended fills, layered fills, and backgrounds\n* Live updates as you change the color, opacity, or blend of the selected element\n\nSmart Sampling\n\nContrast can compare an element’s color with the colors it finds in gradients and images in the background. It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.\n\nBugs\n\nIf you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know! Send us an example test case in Figma along with a short description of what you were expecting, and we’ll have a look.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Element strokes are not yet supported\n\nSmart Sampling Technique\n\nContrast uses RGBQuant to analyze the selection of pixels behind an element. It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.\n\nCredits\n\nContrast was made by the Maark design

Select any number of similar objects in your Figma file.\n2. Run the Master plugin command “Create Component from Objects”\n3. The new main Component will be created\n4. Selected objects will become its Instances WITH all possible overrides applied!\n\n❖ Also Master would help you “attach” objects of any kind to the existing Component, even if it is in another file:\n\n1. Select one Instance or Component. Run “Pick Target Component” command, the plugin will remember selected Component.\n2. Select Instances or other objects you want to turn into Instances of the saved Component.\n3. Run the command called “Link Objects to Target Component”.\n4. All objects will be replaced with Instances of the previously selected Component, keeping overrides where possible.\n\n——————————\n\n❖ When to use Master plugin\n• When you have created several copies of one Frame or Group for exploration and need to turn them into one Component.\n• When realize you should have used Instances of one Component instead of regular objects too late.\n• If you want to create a new master Component for a bunch of existing Instances (clone component).\n• To create different versions of one component for different layouts or screen sizes.\n• You want to create a local copy of a Component, Instances of which were imported from Team Library.\n• If you need to quickly get the ability to manipulate multiple similar objects at once.\n• Create new Master Component and put it to the side while keeping the Instance in place.\n• If you create art with repeating parts and want change them all at once.\n• When you want to “Smart Animate” one Component into another one.\n• Your Instance was detached from Master Component when copying to another file? Reattach it with Master plugin.\n• When you want to copy components to another file and they get detached.\n• To avoid fixing issues with the components imported from Sketch manually.\n• You used Blend plugin on an object and want to change all the copies at once.\n\n——————————\n\n❖ Technical info\n• Selection can include Frames, Groups and Instances of other components. All of them should have similar sets of elements in them. Objects which have different structures will be ignored. Alternatively you can select a bunch of layers of the same type, like texts, ellipses or rectangles.\n• Note that prototyping connections will be removed from processed objects because of the Figma Plugin API limitations.\n\n——————————\n\n❖ About license\nYour license purchase means a lot to me as an indie developer! With the license purchase you will be able to use the plugin as much as you want, while free trial version is limited to five successful uses per file. Please don't share your license code with anyone. If you are purchasing multiple licenses (2, 4 or 8), only share the license code with that amount of people.

When you specify the padding values in the component name you can change the elements inside the component and apply the paddings in one click. The component will automatically resize itself so that it surrounds all other elements within the component according to padding values.\n\nSpecify the padding values within the component group or frame name. E.g. button [12 24]. The format of the padding values is in the same order as CSS.\n\n❖ FEATURES\n✅ Paddi works with Groups, Frames, Components, Libraries.\n✅ Paddi is simple! The only thing you need to do is specify the paddings in the component name\n✅ Recognize components with paddings looking at their names. ⚡️ It works the same as in CSS.\n✅ Paddi is flexible. No limitation there, set the same padding for all sides [12] or different for each one [12 24 14 32].\n✅ Paddi uses a base element as a parent and calculates paddings from it.\n✅ Speed up your workflow! You don’t need to open plugin settings all the time you need to update paddings. You only need to rename the component and run the Paddi.\n✅ Natural master & instance behavior. If you change master component paddings, you don’t need to do anything else to update instances, Paddi will update all instances automatically.\n✅ Paddi works with libraries. Create a master component in your library file and apply the padding for all its instances in any project file. ⚠️ If you change padding for the master component in the library you will have to update all instances in the other files manually.\n\n❖ PADDINGS\nPadding values sets by clockwise from top to left sides. It works the same as in CSS. Examples:\n- [12] - padding for all sides - 12px\n- [12 24] - top&bottom - 12px, right&left - 24 px\n- [12 24 32] - top - 12px, right&left - 24px, bottom - 32px\n- [12 24 32 16] - top - 12px, right - 24px, bottom - 32px, left - 16px\n\n❖ FORMATS\nWe recommend to use space for separating padding values to keep it simple, however, you can use a comma as well. Examples:\n- [12 24]\n- [12, 24, 24, 12]\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A GROUP\n1. Create a rectangle. This element will be the base of the component\n2. Put some text or another shape inside the rectangle\n3. Group these elements\n4. Select the Group and whether rename the Group by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Group\n6. Select the Group and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A FRAME\n1. Write some text or create a shape\n2. Wrap it with a Frame\n3. ⚠️ In case you have only one element in the Frame the paddings will calculate from the Frame to its element. ⚠️ In case you have more than 1 element inside the Frame and want to use this Frame as the base you need to wrap all its elements with a Group\n4. Select the Frame and whether rename the Frame by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Frame\n6. Select the Frame and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A COMPONENT\n1. After you have a Group with some paddings create a master component from it\n2. Set constraints for the master component to make sure its instances will responsive correctly. Set Scale for the base and make sure all other elements have Left and Top\n3. Change elements and run Paddi. ⚠️ Because you can’t change elements position in an instance you will be able to change only the text elements and then apply the paddings\n\n❖ IGNORE\nTo ignore some elements in your component, rename the necessary ones with [ignore] or [nopaddi] at the end of its name.\n\n❖ IMPORTANT TO KNOW\n⚠️ The lowest element in a group or frame is going to be the base of the component! So don't forget to add a base.\n⚠️ The base element in your component will be marked as (base) in the layer name.\n⚠️ You can’t change paddings for instance because you can’t change its elements positioning. To handle it, go to the master component or detach the instance.\n⚠️ If you want to set a Frame as a base and specify paddings for it, wrap all elements inside this frame in a group to have only one element in the frame and then apply Paddi.\n\n❖ WHERE TO USE\n✅ Buttons\n✅ Tab items\n✅ Navigation items\n✅ Dropdown menus\n✅ Tags / Pils / Badges\n✅ Tooltips / Popovers\n✅ Icons\n✅ UI Cards\n✅ Modal dialogs\n✅ Sections\n✅ Etc.\n\n❖ SHORTCUT FOR MAC OS\nTo speed up your workflow add a shortcut to Paddi. It takes a minute to set up but keeps a lot of time later on.\nOpen System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts -> Add new:\n1. Application: Figma\n2. Menu Title: Paddi\n3. Keyboard shortcut: cmd+shift+P (You can use your own)\n\n---\n\n😎 MADE BY\nOleksandr Telnov & Mikhail Voloshin at Dumka.io","version":"4","icon_path":"plugins/746314565953874339/1106/95df1b29-4f77-4936-9573-355b03ba086c-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/746314565953874339/1516/5b0a1f0d-032e-4c54-9668-064c4c40df8c-cover","code_path":"plugins/746314565953874339/1556/1ae7db5a-e960-4499-add3-be245b4d54f6-code","resource_staging_signature":"1ae7db5a-e960-4499-add3-be245b4d54f6","manifest":{"id":"746314565953874339","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Paddi"},"release_notes":"fix (base) element naming","created_at":"2019-10-25T10:50:34.888Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/746314565953874339/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/746314565953874339/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/746314565953874339/code"}},"creator":{"id":"691922202175814854","handle":"Oleksandr Telnov","img_url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eed006e4f965a673444400199c1b6b62?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_o_v2.png"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"759472336242530542","created_at":"2019-09-27T17:51:55.271Z","current_plugin_version_id":"1390","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://twitter.com/aswellasyouare","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-10-18T22:48:41.073Z","install_count":4006,"like_count":62,"view_count":54621,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"779","realtime_token":"/plugin-759472336242530542:1598180360:0:c8e4584680fa6800892ecc5bdef2d8759f05939f","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/759472336242530542/thumbnail","tags":["formatting","generate","styles","text"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"779","user_id":"643912172165629072","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"New York","profile_handle":"vadim","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:48.626Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":2,"name":"Vadim Pleshkov","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/19f56083-e9b1-4ba2-a9df-e631645dd466","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"364","plugin_id":"759472336242530542","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"1390":{"id":"1390","plugin_id":"759472336242530542","name":"Text Styles Generator","description":"Mass create or update local Text Styles based on formating of regular text layers.\n\nHere is how this plugin works: \n\nAfter you called the plugin on one or several text layers, it will check if there is a Local Text Style with the same name as the name of the text layer.\n\n• If Local Text Style with such name doesn't exist, it would be created, based on text layer properties.\n\n• If Local Text style already exists it would be updated, based on text layer properties AND renamed, based on text layer content. \n\nThe additional command \"Draw Current Text Styles\" will generate text layer with applied text style for each found Local Text Style.\n\nPlease note, that plugin works only with local styles.

Just plug in and play.\nWhen styling specific labels with local styles, Tempura Generator generates the code for the label, so you can paste it immediately into the scene you’re developing.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n* To download the Color Style catalog, select the Color Style header and click Download Archive. Unzip the downloaded Archive, and copy and paste its contents into the project. You can then access these colors and use them by typing <<Palette.(Color name)>>\n\n* The same procedure applies for text styles. Select Text Styles, Download File, and copy and paste it into the project. You can then access these text styles by typing <<TextStyles.(Style name)>>\n\n* You can generate a code to compose a label inside the UI of a scene by doing the following: Select the label you want to code, then select Code Header in the plugin, make your choices, and click Copy Style.\n\nWHY USE TEMPURA GENERATOR?\n\nDevelopers are always seeking out ways to save time.

Design Token: Help you to find all the local names defind in figma;\n\nThere are 2 way to use ACSS.\n\n## Pure way:\n\nThis way you do not need setting, just open and generator.\nThe text styles blow will transform to the ACSS.\n\n- `font-size`： ``.fs12{ font-size: 12px; }`...;\n- `font-weight`：`.fw700{ font-weight: 700; }`...;\n- `font-style`：`.fsi{ font-style: italic; }` ...;\n- `line-height`：`.lh16{ line-height: 16px; }`...;\n- `text-align`：`.tac{ text-align: center; }`...;\n- `text-transform`：`.ttc{ text-transform: capitalize; }`...;\n\nIf the text with the `paragraphSpacing` will transform to the `margin-bottom`: `.mb16{ margin-bottom: 16px; }`...;\n\n* ACSS「 Atomic css 」: Each css selector with only one css rules.\n\n##  Custom way:\n\n- You can give each local style name a alias as the css selecor in setting.\n- When the generator match the rules, it will turn out to be the html and the CSS.\n- Even you can custom different setting for different project.\n\nThe other stuff you don't give alias will use ACSS instead\n\n## FAG\n\n1. I can't open the plugin of ACSS in the first time?\nTry 3 times and wait.\n\n2. Why the default name in Design token with `g_` and `c_`?\n- `g_`:  `global_`\n- `c_`:  `color_`\n\n3. How  to  ignore some local styles name?\nJust set those style name with `_` start.\nexp: `_Header`\n\n4.

Design Tokenizer will parse everything it can from these objects.\n\nAdditioally, Design Tokenizer can generate tokens for your margin and padding spacers, radii, and border widths as long as you follow certain conventions:\n\nFrame\n- Create a frame and name it “Sizes.”\n- Created rectangles for each custom style.\n\nSpacer Rectangles\n- Name spacers “spacer/name”. \n- The width and height values are tokenized. \n\nCorner Radius Rectangles\n- Name radii “corner-radius/name”.\n- The corner radius value is tokenized. \n\nBorder Width Rectangles\n- Name border widths “border/name”.\n- The stroke width value is tokenized.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nLimitations:\n- Image-based color styles are not supported.","version":"5","icon_path":"plugins/767048666042724266/1755/d0a46149-1e93-4a3d-b31f-6f0a95a70ef8-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/767048666042724266/3381/1b9912de-1c50-4e73-a828-3b3d60aa1980-cover","code_path":"plugins/767048666042724266/6734/478cc3fe-3d8b-4f76-9483-bce33bd0d18d-code","resource_staging_signature":"478cc3fe-3d8b-4f76-9483-bce33bd0d18d","manifest":{"id":"767048666042724266","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Design Tokenizer"},"release_notes":"• Fixed a bug that prevented line heights from being exported.\n• All layout layers for a grid style are now parsed and expoerted.","created_at":"2020-06-26T20:58:35.469Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/767048666042724266/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/767048666042724266/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/767048666042724266/code"}},"creator":{"id":"740589075415884215","handle":"Lee Brenner","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/779170de-b242-4d2c-b93d-194c27588fa3"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"772054917007268360","created_at":"2019-11-01T11:10:36.300Z","current_plugin_version_id":"3786","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://github.com/kaleidocode-app/color-regulator","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-11-14T20:59:35.790Z","install_count":1470,"like_count":46,"view_count":29335,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"39140","realtime_token":"/plugin-772054917007268360:1598180360:0:e434293a39994d1ec0131b3ce8ae2800453cc684","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/772054917007268360/thumbnail","tags":["bulk","color","manager","renamer","styles","text"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"39140","user_id":"363421902915300361","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Seattle, WA","profile_handle":"miguel","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:44.314Z","follower_count":7,"following_count":7,"name":"Miguel Solorio","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/79964375-145b-44ee-a105-91fa3e99fb0b","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"450","plugin_id":"772054917007268360","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"3786":{"id":"3786","plugin_id":"772054917007268360","name":"Regulator","description":"Bulk rename your color and text styles like a 💯 boss.\n\nSimply run this plugin in a file that has local styles and select which styles you want to rename.

This bug should be fixed soon.\n\nAbout the Create Guides window:\n⚠ To get into it, you need to click on the name of the frame.\n\n1. The Margin parameter is specified in the following order: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left.\n\n2. Some parameters support the \"auto\" value. \n\nIt can be used, for example, to center the columns by setting the margin-left and margin-right parameters to \"auto\".\nIf you specify it only for margin-left, and margin-right set to 0, then the columns will be pressed to the right edge.\n\n⚠ When applying the template, - if its parameters are not suitable for the selected frame, - they will be adjusted.\n\nFor example, if the template contains 10 columns with a width of 100px, and the frame has a width of only 500px, then the number of columns will be reduced to 5.\n\n___\nA demo video with an example of usage can be found here: producthunt.com/posts/guides-inspector-figma-plugin","version":"6","icon_path":"plugins/763500131554051614/1917/9cfac416-3acb-4c7e-b79a-82be2742b729-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/763500131554051614/2836/0928a965-79bd-475d-8e96-5403b0dc34c5-cover","code_path":"plugins/763500131554051614/3615/fd493a2d-7e4c-4503-a104-444609a61f8c-code","resource_staging_signature":"fd493a2d-7e4c-4503-a104-444609a61f8c","manifest":{"id":"763500131554051614","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"Guides inspector"},"release_notes":"— Fixed links.","created_at":"2020-02-22T21:37:44.840Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/763500131554051614/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/763500131554051614/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/763500131554051614/code"}},"creator":{"id":"543309226235743616","handle":"Andreslav Kozlov","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/66ad492f-a684-4745-a1f8-e1211f40eac9"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"778302475291888898","created_at":"2019-11-18T16:56:10.269Z","current_plugin_version_id":"1930","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"lgallo@onshape.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-11-27T21:07:33.099Z","install_count":859,"like_count":14,"view_count":16710,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"450","realtime_token":"/plugin-778302475291888898:1598180360:0:bbed147afaddb77e7bbf6259431dfef961824652","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/778302475291888898/thumbnail","tags":["export","export_formats","export_settings","hdpi","mdpi","png","svg","xhdpi","xxhdpi","xxxhdpi"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"450","user_id":"294126376454475548","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Phoenix, AZ","profile_handle":"450","public_at":"2020-05-09T02:19:43.712Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"name":"Lou Gallo","img_url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc9f72a918cdf844ea93749f193f76ee?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_l_v2.png","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"482","plugin_id":"778302475291888898","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"1930":{"id":"1930","plugin_id":"778302475291888898","name":"Figgy exporter","description":"A simple plugin to create export settings for any selection into common formats for web, iOS and Android development.\n\nHow to use:\n* Select a frame or object to export\n* Run plugin from the plugin list\n* All export formats are built for those selections\n\nFormats:\nSCALE | SUFFIX |  FORMAT\n1x | -

For flexibility the formatting is done using js code where you can use $value as the variable coming from the JSON. Here are a few examples:\n- John-follower -> $value.split('-')[0] -> John\n- 224.50 ->  '€ ' + Math.round($value) -> € 225\n- true -> $value ? 'available' : 'occupied' -> available\n- 1 -> ['Clear', 'Rain', 'Snow'][$value] -> Rain\n- 1988 -> \"'\" + ($value).toString().substring(2,4) -> '88\n- klm -> `https://airlines/${$value}.png` -> https://airlines/klm.png\n\nAPI Request Options\nIn the case you need to add request options to your API call, you can do so in a separate field and provide the options as an object. To find out which options are available and how they are named, check out the following library: https://github.com/Jam3/xhr-request\nExample usage:\n{\n  \"headers\":{\n     \"secret-key\":\"XXX\"\n  }\n}\n\nNotes\n- Supports only JSON\n- You need to manually select which arrays to loop through after selecting the path\n- Data connected to Component layers do not get transferred to its instances. In this case, connect the data to the instance instead, when you copy an instance the data stays connected.\n- To multiply layers quickly, install the Multiply plugin\n- If you the amount of layers on your page exceeds the limit, the info on the sync page will not auto-refresh when something changes on the page, instead you can use the manual refresh button. This is done to improve performance.\n\nLet me know on Twitter if you have questions, requests or feedback!","version":"27","icon_path":"plugins/784880696244762700/5719/27d48f43-dc05-4781-9d72-eba18ea48b4b-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/784880696244762700/2281/1cce70ef-bf6d-4d32-ac9e-6e926a7d7bc1-cover","code_path":"plugins/784880696244762700/7958/52e191a3-bed5-4b00-a31c-f815b28cfa6a-code","resource_staging_signature":"52e191a3-bed5-4b00-a31c-f815b28cfa6a","manifest":{"id":"784880696244762700","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"API / JSON Sync","relaunchButtons":[{"name":"Edit data","command":"edit","multipleSelection":true}]},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-08-13T23:25:00.799Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/784880696244762700/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/784880696244762700/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/784880696244762700/code"}},"creator":{"id":"479274113210373832","handle":"Emin Sinani","img_url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c471cfbaa1fd0b3e8c97151d4706513?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_e_v2.png"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"786075219184960694","created_at":"2019-12-10T03:42:16.825Z","current_plugin_version_id":"8183","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://github.com/kaleidocode-app/vscode-figma-icons","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2019-12-17T23:53:31.369Z","install_count":1946,"like_count":27,"view_count":32695,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"39140","realtime_token":"/plugin-786075219184960694:1598180360:0:4160851281a86be9733ba4f02cbf211b01107894","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/786075219184960694/thumbnail","tags":["codicons","icons","seti","visual_studio_code","visual_studio_code_icons"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"39140","user_id":"363421902915300361","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Seattle, WA","profile_handle":"miguel","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:44.314Z","follower_count":7,"following_count":7,"name":"Miguel Solorio","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/79964375-145b-44ee-a105-91fa3e99fb0b","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"554","plugin_id":"786075219184960694","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"8183":{"id":"8183","plugin_id":"786075219184960694","name":"Visual Studio Code Icons","description":"Easily browse and copy icon glyphs for Visual Studio Code using Codicons and Seti.\n\nThis plugin was originally forked from the Symbol Icons Browser and re-purposed to use for Visual Studio Code icons.

Create a new component, or choose an existing component, and move it out of any parent frames so its frame is at the top level of the document, not embedded inside any other frames.\n\n2. Name the component anything you'd like, but make sure it ends with \" ? \" followed by the name of the condition it represents. Example: \"Header ? Anonymous\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Anonymous\"\n\n3. Place instances of the component into any places within your design you'd like it to appear.\n\n4. Create a new conditional variation, also at the top level within the page. You can do this by duplicating the original component and changing overrides, or you can make a completely new frame with completely different content. Make the new instance or frame into a component, and name it to match the first conditional variation. Example: \"Header ? Logged-in\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Logged-in\"\n\n5. Repeat step 4 for as many conditional variations you'd like to make for this component.\n\n6. Wrap all the conditional variations together in one frame. Name the frame using the component name, followed by \" ?\" at the end. Example: \"Header ?\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ?\"\n\nRepeat the process to set up as many conditionally-swappable components as you need. Run the Conditioner plugin whenever you want to swap all the conditional instances in your design from one variation to another.\n\nEXAMPLE LAYER STRUCTURE\n===\n\nSetting up conditional components:\n---\nFRAME: Header ?\n- COMPONENT: Header ? Anonymous\n- COMPONENT: Header ? Logged-in\n\nFRAME: Navigation / Bottom Tabs ?\n- COMPONENT: Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Anonymous\n- COMPONENT: Navigation / Bottom Tabs ?

Inside that card create a layer called “#background” and a text field called “title”. The Plugin will look for those layers and set the text and change the color. \n\nDate Formatting\nAny text nodes that layer name starts with an # symbol will be set based on the date formatting. Follow the momentjs formatting. Ie: MMMM will result in January. The display syntax style that is in the component will be copied to the date text, for example, if the MMMM is all red and set to font size 20 these properties will be copied over. This applies to text and fills styles.\n\nYou can hide and show text just for days and months with special filters. If you use the layer name #first-month-text only this text will show up on the first of the month. If you use #day-text this text will show up on all days and will hide any other special filter text.\n\nSee formatting here:\nhttps://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/\n\nFormatting\nSet the start and end date for the calendar. You can set margins and gaps for the “day cards” within the plugin ui menu. There are some extra features like skip weekends and breaking at the end of the month.

This plugin will do it for you!\n\nThis plugin will let you do this:\n\n1. Manage style references on a selected node\n2. Auto-update all references as you change origins (keep the plugin open for this)\n3. Export references to make it available for third-party consumers\n4. Switch contexts\n\n# 1. Manage References\n\nSelect a node for which you want to manage references, eg. a rectangle. Open the \"Style References\" plugin and a dialog will appear that let you do it. Currently these styles are supported:\n\n- Fill Style\n- Stroke Style\n- Effect Style\n\nFor each of those there is a section in the dialog where you can manage the origin style to the reference.\n\n- **Origin** That's the _original_ style.\n- **Reference** That's the style to which the origin is copied over when references are updated.\n\n## Transforms\n\nFor paint styles (Fill and Stroke) transforms are available. When styles\nare referenced from origin to reference you can put transforms in between.\nAvailabe are HSL + Opacity values. They will be applied during\nreferencing.\n\nUse this to automate your color palette. Make one color swatch for your\nbase value (e.g. \"Brand / 500\"). A darker color would take your base value as\nreference and set lightness to \"-20\" - name it for example \"Brand / 300\".\n\n# 2. Export\n\nYou can export your references to jsonbin.io and by that make it available for third-party consumers, e.g. if you want to update your design tokens in your code. Here is how:\n\nEnter credentials in settngs:\n\n1. Create an account and copy the API Key\n2. Create a bin and copy the bin URL\n\nOn the tools tab the `Export Settings` button becomes available. Clicking the button will export your references.\n\n# 3. Import\n\nYou can import your earlier exported references from jsonbin.io. That is really helpful when you duplicated your document - figma will not copy over your stored references. Here is how to import references:\n\n1. Duplicate a document\n2. Open the old document, open the plugin, go to settings and copy the Bin URL\n3. Go the new new document (the plugin should still be opened), paste the URL into the input for import and click the button next to it.\n4. A notification will appear telling you how much references were imported.\n5. You can work with your new document the same way as the old one now - win!\n\n# 4. Contexts\n\nContexts are a lightweight way to organize various theme modes within one document. E.g. if you have light and dark mode in one document, you may want to give styles for respective styles a specific suffix, e.g. `.$dark` - With defined contexts, you can swap between them quickly and then use Themer to export them.\n\n## Workflow Suggestion\n\nUse it in combination with Themer:\n\n1. Set your variants for each context (`§light` and `§dark`)\n2. Select a context\n3. Use `Style References` to map those \"compiled\" styles\n4. Use `Themer` to export and apply them\n\n### Things to Know\n\n- When setting the origin style the suggestions only show local styles, that is also due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for shared team libraries. That's fair - figma keeps us safe, give them credit for that :)\n\nIt still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the style references dialog in order to persist it.\n\n- Once you have one node \"under management\", you may want to change the local style but once you update references, those new ones will be overridden. Re-select the node again and the references dialog will provide you options for migrating styles, to either keep the old one or use the new one.\n\n- Once you link origin to reference the node itself will show the reference as its local style, which might give you wonders, yet is expected and the correct behavior.","version":"10","icon_path":"plugins/791262205400516364/6172/c0ab1cbe-a853-45f9-800c-65d1255bae55-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/791262205400516364/6172/c0ab1cbe-a853-45f9-800c-65d1255bae55-cover","code_path":"plugins/791262205400516364/6306/6301e6de-0289-4d35-b96c-693b07207638-code","resource_staging_signature":"6301e6de-0289-4d35-b96c-693b07207638","manifest":{"id":"791262205400516364","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/main.js","name":"Theemo - Style Automator"},"release_notes":"- Much more improvements to performance\n- When changing a style that belongs to an active context, references auto-update now, too","created_at":"2020-06-07T12:13:14.648Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/791262205400516364/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/791262205400516364/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/791262205400516364/code"}},"creator":{"id":"598629960351545105","handle":"Thomas Gossmann","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/a58acd57-5569-459a-be44-7f170846a4f3"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"755467873814160138","created_at":"2019-09-16T16:39:37.028Z","current_plugin_version_id":"7399","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"grigoriymashkovtsev@gmail.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-02-12T00:31:42.540Z","install_count":1068,"like_count":43,"view_count":20973,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"1602","realtime_token":"/plugin-755467873814160138:1598180360:0:9e80d1b02d78f596a7dfd0bbbb181252defcc737","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/755467873814160138/thumbnail","tags":["fonts","text","typetoday","typography"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"1602","user_id":null,"team_id":"805151920977405941","org_id":null,"location":"","profile_handle":"typetoday","public_at":"2020-01-31T19:06:38.268Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"name":"type.today","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/04a57135-fe1c-4e64-abe6-09889eb79a7a","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"688","plugin_id":"755467873814160138","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"7399":{"id":"7399","plugin_id":"755467873814160138","name":"type.today screen shooter","description":"Type.today screen shooter helps you to find the best font for your project from the type.today library.\n\nType.today and tomorrow are two showcases — two collections.

The plugin is completely FREE for use as long as your compression usage is available.\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n1. Install `AD Compressor` and run it inside of a project\n2. Enter and verify your Tinify API(require for the first time — browser, application or machine)\n3. Select frames or objects you want to compress(by default, ONLY the existing & visible FRAME(s) would be automatically selected.)\n4. When all the frames are ready, you can hit `COMPRESS` button to compress all images are over 150kB(default)\n5. OPTIONAL: if you would like to give a nice formatted prefix for each image, you can use the `OUTPUT PREFIX` input field\n6. Once the compression is done, you can `DOWNLOAD` all the final outputs within a ZIP\n\nNOTES\n\n- This plugin would only compress if the image is over than the compression setting(default 150kB), any file sizes are lower than this setting would not run compression(The idea is to make the image size smaller but keep the best quality). \n\n- By default, ONLY the existing FRAME(s) would be automatically selected.

Note how all the layers within a component or instance will be populated with data from the same record.\n\n---------------\n\nAdding a data source\n\n  •  Try http://myjson.com/ for simple JSON hosting.\n  •  If you want to populate layers randomly, use arrays in your first level of JSON values, e.g. { “users\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ], “jobs”: [ objectA, objectB, …, objectC ] }.\n  •  Data from these objects is referenced using curly brackets {…} and dot notation, allowing you to populate structured data like {users.name.first} and {jobs.description}.\n  •  If you only have a single array, you don’t need to reference the first key. E.g. for { “data\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ] }, write {name.first} instead of {data.name.first}\n\nPopulating text\n\n  •  Populate an entire text layer by renaming the layer. \n  •  Alternatively populate a part of a text layer by adding your curly brackets within the text (e.g. “I love {location.city}” becomes “I love New York”). \n  •  The plugin remembers the parts it populated, so you can populate the same layers again and again.\n\nPopulating images\n\n  •  Populate images by renaming a shape layer. \n  •  The data source for images must be a URL to a hosted image.\n  •  Try https://source.unsplash.com/ for easy hosted images.\n\nPopulating a component/instance\n\n  •  When you select a bunch of regular layers, the plugin randomly chooses the records to populate them with. If you want them to all be populated from the same record, turn them into a component (or instance).\n  •  Add data to your library components so that they’re ready to go!\n\nRoadmap...?\n\n  •  Manage multiple data sources\n  •  Use data from google sheets and other sources\n  •  Basic functions like random() and if()\n  •  DM me suggestions!","version":"7","icon_path":"plugins/787488293482536319/2844/dfd60476-8426-471f-9516-bb7ff63d45e1-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/787488293482536319/2845/0e276e86-97fb-408a-9eaf-0cb4af66a71b-cover","code_path":"plugins/787488293482536319/3637/d83bd8c2-28c0-475e-bca5-10b7fd39fa30-code","resource_staging_signature":"d83bd8c2-28c0-475e-bca5-10b7fd39fa30","manifest":{"id":"787488293482536319","ui":"build/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"build/code.js","menu":[{"name":"Populate Selected","command":"populate-selected"},{"name":"Manage Data Source","command":"manage-sources"}],"name":"Data Populator"},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-02-23T23:19:06.724Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/787488293482536319/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/787488293482536319/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/787488293482536319/code"}},"creator":{"id":"756772884015410003","handle":"Patrick Morgan","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/4279b661-ee24-438f-98f1-22aaaccb63a2"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"796759972238579874","created_at":"2020-01-08T15:19:40.467Z","current_plugin_version_id":"5484","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://git.io/JvcJc","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-01-27T22:56:43.612Z","install_count":1402,"like_count":24,"view_count":36932,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"69","realtime_token":"/plugin-796759972238579874:1598180360:0:51e106715e28133eb64f4bb80e0be70205616c4b","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/796759972238579874/thumbnail","tags":["automatic","filters","generator","grid","header","striped","table"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"69","user_id":"796713061643508533","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Singapore","profile_handle":"stevahnes","public_at":"2020-01-21T00:23:29.356Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":1,"name":"Stevanus Satria","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/90f8c979-9889-44be-9760-5228732882d7","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"625","plugin_id":"796759972238579874","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"5484":{"id":"5484","plugin_id":"796759972238579874","name":"GridGen | Automatic Table Generator","description":"Utilizes built-in Figma rectangles, lines, and texts to generate tables with neatly organized layers.\n\nHow-To Use:\n• Select one of three constraint modes (keyboard shortcuts added):\n   ‣ Cell and table size (\"Alt + 1\")\n   ‣ Count and cell size (\"Alt + 2\")\n   ‣ Count and table size (\"Alt + 3\")\n• Modify the values in the textbox and the checkboxes\n• \"Create\" to generate table, or \"Cancel\" to exit\n• Supports both mouse and keyboard navigations:\n   ‣ \"Tab\" to go to next input\n   ‣ \"Shift + Tab\" to go to previous input\n   ‣ \"Arrow\" keys on textboxes to increase/decrease by 1\n   ‣ \"Shift + Arrow\" keys on textboxes to increaes/decrease by 10\n   ‣ \"Enter\" on checkboxes to toggle\n   ‣ \"Enter\" on buttons to click\n   ‣ \"Shift + R\" to reset input to cached values, if any\n   ‣ \"Shift + C\" to initiate table creation\n   ‣ Shortcuts to switch between constraint modes (see above)\n\nCurrent Capabilites:\n• Supports up to 100 rows and columns\n• Supports table up to 5000px by 5000px (width by height)\n• Supports 3 constraint modes (with keyboard shortcuts)\n   ‣ Cell and table size\n   ‣ Count and cell size\n   ‣ Count and table size\n• Enhanced UI experience with validations and loader\n• With/without headers, and ability to specify header height\n• When header is included, specify with/without floating filters\n• Supports striped tables\n• Ability to select both primary and striped colors of the table\n• With/without borders, and ability to define border color\n• Automated population of content and header texts\n• Specify fonts family and style based on list of installed fonts\n• Specify table and header font sizes\n• Caching and preloading of last input\n• Resetting to last cached input upon changes\n\nWork-in-Progress:\n• Other units besides pixel\n\nOther feature suggestions are welcome!\n\nNote:\n• \"GridMod\" is approved!

Install TinyImage and run the plugin inside your project.\n2. Select the exportable images you would like to compress.\n3. Choose your default compression level from 1-100.\n4. Optionally set compression levels per image or configure settings.\n5. Click the \"Compress\" button.\n6. Download and enjoy your compressed images!\n\nFor step-by-step video tutorials: \n• Basic image compression - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEXtO-RKlLs\n• Compressing PDF files - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZpxfMcZuM4\n• Creating animated GIFs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYTVv5Cf94\n\n— Additional Notes\n\n• Please ensure you've added export settings (by clicking \"Export +\" in the right hand Figma column) to any layers you would like to compress, otherwise they won't show up when you open TinyImage, just like the standard Figma exports work.\n\n• If you need multiple sizes (eg. @1x, @2x) or formats (JPG, PNG, SVG and PDF) per image, please add them to the layer's \"Export\" settings.\n\n• If you add new export settings to your layers while TinyImage is already running, you can click the \"Refresh\" icon in the top right TinyImage toolbar to make them show up without restarting the plugin.\n\n• To convert all JPGs and PNGs to WebP (or use Progressive JPEG encoding), click the \"Settings\" icon and check either option as desired before clicking \"Compress Selected\".\n\n• To merge multiple frames into a single PDF, please ensure your page has at least 2 visible frames inside of it, then click the \"All Frames to Single PDF\" button.\n\n• To create an animated GIF from the selected layers in TinyImage, click the \"Create GIF\" button, configure speeds and settings, then click \"Export to GIF\".\n\n• By default, opening TinyImage without any layers selected in Figma will list all of the layers on your page containing export settings. You can also click/highlight layers in Figma to quickly select only those images compressing if you have lots to browse through in your page.\n\n• Compressing PNG and PDF exports can take a bit longer than JPG and SVG exports, especially if they're very detailed or have large dimensions. TinyImage will warn you if an image is too large to compress.\n\n• Safari has compatibility issues; please run TinyImage in another browser (like Chrome or Firefox) or the Figma desktop app.\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried compressing images with TinyImage 15 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key.

Crowdin is a cloud-based localization solution that speeds up and automates translation. Crowdin helps tech companies localize their apps, websites, games, marketing content, and more. As a company-wide solution, it is the place where all teams involved can collaborate and manage the multilingual content together.\n\nWith Crowdin plugin you can\n- Quickly generate multi-language creative assets.\n- Customize the translated copies and fix inconsistencies before the programming starts.\n- Add to your mockups source texts already uploaded to the Crowdin project by other teams.\n- Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin project for translators’ reference.\n\nCrowdin and Figma integration works both ways, and the plugin has 2 modes – Page Translation and Crowdin Strings.\n\nPage Translation Mode – Test Designs Before Development\n\nThis mode helps to send texts to Crowdin with the context for translators in a click and upload translations back to Figma. Use this mode to quickly generate multi-language creative assets, like brochures, stickers, and more. As well as preview and customize translated designs before mockups go to development.\n\nIn Crowdin, you can apply different approaches to get the content translated:\n- Pre-translate texts via Machine Translation engines.\n- Invite in-house translators.\n- Hire a professional translation agency.\n- Engage your community in the translation process.\n\nWorking on the texts on Crowdin, translators get design previews as they are on Figma, along with other localization resources like Translation Memories, Glossaries, and more. \n\nCrowdin Strings Mode – Get Source Texts and Upload Screenshots\n\nCrowdin Strings mode allows you to get source texts that are already uploaded to the Crowdin project by other teams and add them to your designs in a click. Great for teams that start localization right from the start and helps to use real texts instead of ‘Lorem Ipsum’ in the designs you create.\n\nWorking in this mode, you can also automatically upload tagged screenshots of the frames where you used the source texts. Screenshots are visible for translators in the Crowdin Editor (a place where all translations happen) and will give more context.\n\nHow to Set Up\n\nTo get started, you will need a Crowdin account and a localization project under it. You can create a new project, or ask for manager access to the existing one. Sign up at https://accounts.crowdin.com/register \n\nIf you manage a project in Crowdin yourself after a 14-day free trial, select one of the subscription plans at https://crowdin.com/pricing#annual.\n\nTo connect Figma and Crowdin accounts:\n\n1. Install Crowdin for Figma Plugin.\n2. Open the necessary Figma file.\n3. Head to the menu in the top-left corner and select Plugins > Crowdin.\n4. Provide Personal Access Token. You can generate it in your Account Settings in Crowdin. \n5. If you’re connecting your Crowdin Enterprise account, specify your organization name.\n\nGet detailed guides on how to use Crowdin for Figma plugin at https://support.crowdin.com/figma-plugin/\n\nContact us 24/7 if you need further assistance https://crowdin.com/contacts","version":"11","icon_path":"plugins/802555101361690489/2948/4d88b27e-d971-4e54-9b9d-ed6b0596f9a0-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/802555101361690489/3211/e0eeb178-aa25-4742-b200-4042e7bf91ea-cover","code_path":"plugins/802555101361690489/6237/83b42022-f69d-4d28-8614-c82edcca1b5c-code","resource_staging_signature":"83b42022-f69d-4d28-8614-c82edcca1b5c","manifest":{"id":"802555101361690489","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"Crowdin"},"release_notes":"Stability improvements","created_at":"2020-06-03T11:48:45.151Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/802555101361690489/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/802555101361690489/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/802555101361690489/code"}},"creator":{"id":"802509738121999283","handle":"Crowdin","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/c66bf92c-2377-4a82-881f-e5d94d5153ef"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"798575277354069347","created_at":"2020-01-13T15:33:02.932Z","current_plugin_version_id":"3272","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://github.com/ahmednooor/RTLit/issues","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-02-04T23:31:50.481Z","install_count":558,"like_count":6,"view_count":6638,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"902312","realtime_token":"/plugin-798575277354069347:1598180360:0:b923c987812d731f46daee08e0451a0c8f4dc555","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/798575277354069347/thumbnail","tags":["arabic","figma","in","left","persian","right","rtl","text","to","type","urdu","write"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"902312","user_id":"649159565665974012","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":null,"profile_handle":"ahmednoor","public_at":"2020-02-05T05:31:53.385Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"name":"Ahmed Noor E Alam","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/4b19e880-b792-4e95-b7a1-31489fcb9c1e","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"628","plugin_id":"798575277354069347","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"3272":{"id":"3272","plugin_id":"798575277354069347","name":"RTLit","description":"\"RTLit\" is a Figma plugin that converts the Arabic/Persian/Urdu text into readable format as Figma currently does not support RTL languages.\n\nBehind the scenes it reverses the characters and does some other things to turn RTL gobbledigook into readable text.

Create a Coda doc with a table in it, or use the example doc that's provided. The example doc already has data for you to get started with.\n2. Fill individual layers by selecting the layer you want to change, and then select the relevant column in the plugin selector. \n3. Group layers, or create a component, to keep related info together. \n4. Select an entire frame or multiple groups to update all of the layers at once. \n\n→ Live Data\nTo pull live data into your Figma designs, create a Packs Table in Coda. Using Packs you can pull in data from Wikipedia, Spotify, Intercom and more.  Once you've set up your table, you can connect your design to that table and watch it fill up with real data. \n\n→ Custom Data\nTo pull custom data into your Figma docs, create a Table in Coda. You can enter text, image URLs, formulas, and more. Then, connect your layers to that table, and watch your designs fill up with your own data. \n\nSee more info here: https://coda.io/d/Example-data-doc_dFOHtXx4pnz","version":"3","icon_path":"plugins/738264841927149297/3330/07fee031-93b0-4396-8206-0b9e05c8c4b8-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/738264841927149297/3048/b4333e20-642d-4e7a-bf99-94216a77dc34-cover","code_path":"plugins/738264841927149297/5745/7bfa36d4-ecb7-4e90-9945-e44cace0df33-code","resource_staging_signature":"7bfa36d4-ecb7-4e90-9945-e44cace0df33","manifest":{"id":"738264841927149297","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"Coda for Figma"},"release_notes":"minor fixes to handling of image urls and empty rows","created_at":"2020-05-11T20:56:10.089Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/738264841927149297/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/738264841927149297/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/738264841927149297/code"}},"creator":{"id":"720845012567652449","handle":"Carlo Jörges","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/aaabe887-93bc-49f7-a11f-c828cb306b32"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"830178746103135228","created_at":"2020-04-09T20:33:57.045Z","current_plugin_version_id":"4978","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"kurt@kurtemch.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-04-22T22:57:12.797Z","install_count":633,"like_count":16,"view_count":45263,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"317005","realtime_token":"/plugin-830178746103135228:1598180360:0:c3e26ccdcc70e611cb5e5c90762c9c6468818201","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/830178746103135228/thumbnail","tags":["assets","components","flyout","libraries","menu","sketch","team","viewer"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"317005","user_id":"795682634325626564","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Pittsburgh, PA","profile_handle":"317005","public_at":"2020-05-10T02:02:07.830Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"name":"Kurt Emch","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/a473e779-e68d-49ed-8e04-f2985e68fb6b","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"906","plugin_id":"830178746103135228","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"4978":{"id":"4978","plugin_id":"830178746103135228","name":"Components Flyout Menu","description":"Browse and insert local and team components via a flyout menu. Familiar workflow to Sketch users.\n\n👉 Features\n\n• Browse local and team components in a flyout menu.\n• Less clicking: Hover over each menu group to expand submenus.\n• Clicking on a menu item group will automatically fetch the first sorted component at the deepest nest level.\n• Control the size of the plugin modal with a resize handle in the bottom right. Although the plugin modal will scroll horizontally and vertically you may wish to size the window to a more convenient size based on how many levels your menu has.\n\n👉 Team Libraries\nTeam libraries are supported with a small workaround.\n\nTo add a team library:\n1. Open the source library document and launch this plugin.\n2. Click \"Add Team Library\". The library should then appear in the \"Saved Team Libraries\" section.\nNote: This does not \"copy\" the team library, it stores a reference to it so all component connections maintain their connection.\n\nTo update a team library:\n1. Open the source library document and launch this plugin.\n2. Click \"Update Team Library\".\n\nTo remove a team library:\n1. Click the minus sign next to any saved team library to remove it. To re-add, follow the steps to add the library.\n\nTo use components from saved team libraries:\n1. Assuming the team library has been added, enable the team library via Figma's assets panel as normal.\n\n👉 Known Issues\n\n1. Documents with many local components may take a few moments to populate at first. You may experience this as a frozen plugin when first launching it, however give it some time before shutting it down. This is because the plugin has to search all of the nodes in the current document for components.\n2. Team libraries are stored by name, so if you have 2 team libraries called \"Design System\", saving one will overwrite the other in this plugin.\n3. Saved team libraries do not persist if browser cache has been cleared. This is because the reference is stored in figma.clientStorage.","version":"2","icon_path":"plugins/830178746103135228/4907/9e8ac649-7e1a-415e-b59c-ff1f5be44437-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/830178746103135228/4907/9e8ac649-7e1a-415e-b59c-ff1f5be44437-cover","code_path":"plugins/830178746103135228/4978/e252efaa-8173-4c6c-bb30-4d5bfd8047aa-code","resource_staging_signature":"e252efaa-8173-4c6c-bb30-4d5bfd8047aa","manifest":{"id":"830178746103135228","ui":"index.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Components Flyout Menu"},"release_notes":"Fixes a z-index issue in overlapping menus","created_at":"2020-04-13T14:32:05.418Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/830178746103135228/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/830178746103135228/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/830178746103135228/code"}},"creator":{"id":"795682634325626564","handle":"Kurt Emch","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/d67eeaa7-f9ce-4154-8a93-04424a308b61"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"830523897419272248","created_at":"2020-04-10T19:25:27.528Z","current_plugin_version_id":"5306","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"http://varun.ca/","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-04-22T23:01:06.123Z","install_count":864,"like_count":24,"view_count":30904,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"940","realtime_token":"/plugin-830523897419272248:1598180360:0:b66be9850f3df874924dc05a5788e9ed9f7bb99b","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/830523897419272248/thumbnail","tags":["generative","jali","tiles","truchet"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"940","user_id":"364086864121057528","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Toronto","profile_handle":"varun","public_at":"2020-04-23T00:54:14.576Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"name":"Varun Vachhar","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/818a9496-dcdc-44e1-9001-5f712f3eff4c","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"908","plugin_id":"830523897419272248","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"5306":{"id":"5306","plugin_id":"830523897419272248","name":"Jali","description":"Generative truchet tiles.\n\nJali is the term for a perforated stone or latticed screen, usually with an ornamental geometry pattern.

In some cases, we have 15px spacing, and in another place, 14px. It's hard always to update all these spacings manually.\n\nWith the help of auto layout, we can resolve this problem. Just turn on the auto layout feature with zero spacing between the elements and use \"spacers\" between.\n\nThere are different ways, but I prefer to use the 8-Point Grid System. You can use premade \"spacers\" from the public library (https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings) and place them between the elements. In that case, you will make sure that the spacings between the components are consistent.\n\nHow it works\nAdd the library https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings or have own symbols that have \"$spacing\" word in the name;\nUse them when needed\nIf you want to hide them, select a parent frame and run the plugin. It will look for all spacers that were used on the frame and will set zero opacity\nIf you want to show spacers back, just rerun the plugin. If the first spacer on the row will have zero opacity, it will set 100% for all spacers found on the selected frame.\n\nPro tip\nYou can use smart spacing prediction feature! Here is how it works https://twitter.com/faridsabitov/status/1281697269948067845\n\nPro tip\nYou can set \"cmd\"+\"option\"+\"H\" hotkey via system preferences in Mac to toggle spacers visibility quickly.

Install Bannerify and create a new Figma project.\n2. Create as many different sized frames as you need for your banners.\n3. Add any images, text and components to your frames.\n4. Run Bannerify inside the page containing your banner frames.\n5. Apply some animations and timings to the layers inside each frame.\n6. Click the \"Export to HTML\" or \"Export to GIF/WebM\" button.\n7. Choose your export options and click the \"Export\" button.\n8. Download and enjoy your banners!\n\nFor a step-by-step video tutorial, visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TA088FNulA\n\n— Additional Notes\n\n• To start playing with Bannerify right away, you can duplicate this pre-designed example Figma file – https://figma.fun/8Eg9Rf – to easily see how Bannerify works and what the layer structure can look like. This Figma file already has some example animations set on the layers of each banner, too.\n\n• To quickly get started designing your own banners, Bannerify will offer to create some standard banner sizes automatically for you if you run Bannerify inside of an empty Figma page.\n\n• If you add or update any layers in your Figma file while Bannerify is already running, you can click the \"Refresh\" icon in the Bannerify header menu to refresh your layers and make them show up in the Bannerify timeline and real-time previews.\n\n• By default, Bannerify will export all image layers @1x. You can change this for any layer by clicking \"Export +\" in the right-hand column of Figma's UI and adding your own export size setting (@2x, @3x etc).\n\n• Bannerify will automatically detect if a layer contains areas of full transparency and set \"PNG\" as the default export format, otherwise it will be set to \"JPG\". You can override this to set the export format of any layer to JPG, PNG or SVG (for vectors) by adding your own export setting.\n\n• Text layers will automatically be exported as SVG paths to make them sharper than PNG images, have lower file sizes, and avoid loading custom web fonts for each banner.\n\n• You can set a solid background colour of any banner by setting the solid \"fill\" of that frame to the colour you need in Figma (to use gradient backgrounds, please fill a full rectangle layer at the bottom of your frame's layers).\n\n• Safari has compatibility issues; please run Bannerify in another browser (like Chrome or Firefox) or the Figma desktop app.\n\n• The name of your Figma document will be used as the \"title\" tag for the exported HTML Bannerify preview page.\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried exporting banners with Bannerify 10 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key. Your license key will allow you or your team to animate and export an unlimited amount of HTML banners using Bannerify.\n\nTo purchase a license or to find out more, please visit https://figmaticapp.com/bannerify","version":"62","icon_path":"plugins/796124491692147799/6436/f0c2bf55-fef8-4f14-b014-1e33b1f92307-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/796124491692147799/8061/954f241e-5ed9-4b78-a173-beb5ac8084ab-cover","code_path":"plugins/796124491692147799/8098/a9018b9f-05d8-4482-8a37-d5f2da36ddaf-code","resource_staging_signature":"a9018b9f-05d8-4482-8a37-d5f2da36ddaf","manifest":{"id":"796124491692147799","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Bannerify","relaunchButtons":[{"name":"Bannerify","command":"export"}]},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-08-18T06:47:47.360Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/796124491692147799/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/796124491692147799/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/796124491692147799/code"}},"creator":{"id":"789008748133784695","handle":"Figmatic","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/9390c234-cbe6-4de4-b3ff-73cfb0fb34a0"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"813970431341620710","created_at":"2020-02-25T03:07:53.672Z","current_plugin_version_id":"8097","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://github.com/ryonakae/figma-plugin-team-library-component-browser/issues","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-02-27T23:15:41.962Z","install_count":912,"like_count":24,"view_count":36696,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"828596","realtime_token":"/plugin-813970431341620710:1598180360:0:8dd394df5a0fa102993aec896390166afa1f4168","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/813970431341620710/thumbnail","tags":["component","components","instance","libraries","library","replace","swap","team"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"828596","user_id":"639302271230352182","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":null,"profile_handle":"ryo_dg","public_at":"2020-02-28T00:36:07.694Z","follower_count":2,"following_count":0,"name":"Ryo Nakae","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/d9206a35-0890-4239-9c00-c001ae3561ce","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"754","plugin_id":"813970431341620710","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"8097":{"id":"8097","plugin_id":"813970431341620710","name":"Team Library Component Browser","description":"List, browse, and create instance your team library (and local) components.\n\n🔥 What you can:\n\n- List and browse your team library components.\n- Create instance of conponent from this plugin.\n- Swap the instance and selection(s).\n- Keep the size and layout of selection when you swap.\n\n👉 How to use Team Library Component Browser:\n\n1.

To change the camera angle select an angle preset or click and drag over the device. Alternatively you can set an exact rotation in degrees on the right. You can also modify the rotation of the model itself there.\n5. Choose a device color. If you have local color styles click the color swatch to choose one, or manually enter a hex code.\n6.

From Image","description":"Use OCR to copy text from an image fill.\n\nEver wish you could quickly grab some text from a static image? This plugin makes it easy with the magic of optical character recognition.\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n* If you attempt to run the plugin on a static image larger than 1MB with a free API key, it will silently fail. Working on an error message right now.\n* Current workaround: resize the image to a smaller size, copy as PNG, paste it back onto the cavnas, rerun the plugin on the new, smaller image.\n* Alternatively, you can upgrade your API key to the paid tier at OCR.Space.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n* This plugin takes advantage of the free API offered by OCR.Space (https://ocr.space). You'll need to acquire your own free API key here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI#free\n* Copy your API key and paste it into the plugin.\n* Once your key is saved, select a layer with a static image as a fill, and run the plugin\n* After a brief delay, the text will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n* You can only select one layer at a time currently\n* If an image has more than one image fill, it will only work for the top one\n* As a quirk of how the plugin was made, you will briefly see a non-interactive window pop up. This allows for content to be added to your clipboard.\n* In addition, the same limitations that apply to OCR.Space's API free tier applies obviously to this plugin, such as file size limit, and rate limiting. See full info here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI\n\nThis plugin is 100% open source.

Then click the pencil (edit) icon on the group to add your own presets or edit the names. When done editing the collection, click the checkmark icon near the group name.\n\nSimply click the desired preset to apply it to all selected frames. If no frames are selected, a new frame will be created.\n\nThe plugin doesn’t only save dimensions, but also other frames properties like color, effects, grids and export settings. You also can share your templates with teammates or, if you fancy it, Figma community. Import a shared template by entering the key and pressing plus icon, try it with key “bootstrap” (without quotes).\n\nResizing the plugin window:\nYou can resize the window of the plugin by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow keys when the plugin window is in focus (click anywhere in the window if resize is not working) — similar to how you can resize objects in Figma.\n\nKnown issues:\n• All templates are currently saved locally to your Figma app or browser. If you clear the browser cache, reinstall the app or log out of Figma, your templates may be lost.\n• You cannot reoder groups or templates yet.

Not happy with your confetti or bar graph? Just. Keep. Randomizing!\n\nYou've got three methods of randomization to choose from, per property!\n\n- \"Range\" is handy for randomizing bars in a graph, for example, allowing you to constrain height between a min and max\n\n- \"List\" is handy for making confetti, for example, by letting you randomize the fillColor of your selected elements, but keeping them within your chosen palette.\n\n- \"Calc\" does multiplication or addition rather than just picking numbers out of the air. Consider slowly growing bubbles by multiplying their width and height by 1.1–1.5x. Just keep randomizing and they'll keep growing slightly until you're happy with the results.\n\nFor each type, you have the option to apply the randomized values in a sorted order. Consider making a bar graph, but you want to show profits getting bigger and bigger. Generate as many as you like until you're happy, in mere seconds!\n\nNote: If you try to randomize a property that's unsupported by the elements in your selection (\"strokeColor\" on elements without a stroke applied already), that property will simply be skipped; supported properties will still be randomized.\n\nFeedback would be very much appreciated.

is Phrase?\n\nFor digital products offered in global markets, translation has become an integral part of the user experience. But the people involved often struggle to be on the same page. UX copy shouldn’t be left for last, and neither should translating it into multiple languages.\n\nPhrase is a Translation Management Solution with the whole team in mind. It’s a cloud-based platform that enables Designers, Copywriters, Product Managers, Developers and Translators to come together to create the best local user experience for global digital products.\nFor more information please visit: https://phrase.com/\n\nWhy Phrase and Figma?\n\nFinally, you can build a bridge between Product Design and Translation teams by syncing texts between Figma and Phrase.

I became tired of manually applying export settings across assets and projects. So this was born March 21st, locked up in my apartment.\n\n⚡️ Lazy Export allows the user to apply default export settings to selected objects in Figma.\n\n🧠 How does it work?\nThere are two ways to trigger your export settings to be applied. The first is a window giving you UI access to run the plugin commands. (Set Platform, Apply Settings, Clear Settings)\nThe second is via the plugin menu; this makes the actions searchable in Figma with the `⌘+/` command.\n\n🔧  Currently supported:\n• IOS \n• IOS Adv.\n• Android\n• Android Adv.\n• Web\n\n📦 Export Options\n\n✨ Export Settings\nWith Lazy export, you have two mobile options on how you can apply export settings.\n\n• Default Export\n• Advanced Export\n\nWith the default export, this follows the trends for exporting assets for mobile at the different screen densities. Advanced is still being worked on for a smooth workflow.\n\nℹ️ The end goal for Advanced Export Options, would be for a developer to hit apply, and Figma exports a folder of assets the developer can drop into Android Studio or Xcode.\n\nAndroid Suffix\n`drawable-mdpi`\n\nIOS Suffix\n`/default-asset@1x`\n\nAndroid Advance Suffix\n`/drawable-mdpi/default-asset`\n\nIOS Advance Suffix\n`/default-asset.imageset/default-asset@1x`\n\n✍️ Custom Asset Naming\n\nRight now, if you do not apply a custom name to each asset, a default one will be used. \n    📆 I have plans on the roadmap to adjust this.\n\nDefault Name String = `default-asset`\n\n🐛 Have a feature request or bug?

Install Pixelay and run the plugin inside your project.\n2. Select the frames you want to compare with your website.\n3. Paste in the URL you would like to compare your frames to.\n4. Optionally add different website page URLs per frame.\n5. Click the \"Compare Designs\" button.\n6.

This is not a problem for local development environments (eg. http://localhost:3000) or development servers that you manage for your own websites.\n\n• If your website CSS uses \"vh\" units for any elements, please note that these may appear much taller than they normally would at a resonable browser height due to Pixelay setting the viewport height to be the same as your full Figma mockup.\n\n• If you add/remove any frames in Figma while Pixelay is running, you can click on the \"Refresh\" icon in the top right of the Pixelay Figma plugin to refresh the list of available frames to compare.\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried comparing Figma designs with Pixelay 10 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key.

Primary600? That name doesn't mean much. PrimaryButtonLabel? That's clear as can be.\n\nThis plugin makes it simple to maintain a collection of semantically named colors that derive their color from your base palette. Not only does this allow you to increase clarity of usage, it also lays the foundation necessary for theming within your apps. \n\nFor more details on why you should implement your colors this way, read this blog post:\nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7\n\nUsing Semantic Color Sync is simple. First, create your base palette. For each base palette color, add a consistent prefix, such as “.palette/”\n\nNext, create a series of semantically named colors. In the description for each semantically named color, add the base palette color it derives from (including the prefix). For example: “.palette/primary600”\n\nNext, when you decide to change your primary hue from blue to bright pink (good choice, btw), the Semantic Color Sync plugin will automatically search through every semantically named color and update their color to match the updates made in your base palette. \n\nNo need to update things by hand... Ugh. Just tweak your base palette and run this plugin to propagate the changes throughout all of your semantically named colors!\n\nAnd again, if you’re curious why this is useful, this blog post has it all laid out:

Just select anything you would like to \"neumorph\", open the plugin and boom. It adds shadows and gradient fills to your selection, which you can customize to your needs.\n\nWhat is neumorphism?\n\nIt's a UI trend which is using multiple shadows and gradients to \"fake\" light and to bring back a more natural and realistic look and feel. Kind of like skeuomorphism in iOS back in 2007. Read more about it here: https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6\n\n—\n\nA few tips how to create beautiful neumorphic designs:\n\n- The background layer and the layer you are \"neumorphing\" should have the same color.\n\n- If you neumorph' text, be sure to also have it the same color, open the plugin, and when you're done, you can change the text color to a darker one, for better readability. \n\n- Neumorphism doesn't work on pure white or pure black, because it adds shadows that are darker / brighter than the background/current selection fill. If you use pure white or black, it will miss one of the shadows and it won't feel \"neumorphistic\" anymore. I'll suggest to take a kind of bluish tint of white / black.\n\n—\n\nThank you very much for the kind help for the color calculation-algorithm from Adam, he built the site https://neumorphism.io/ on which you can generate neumorphic CSS shadows.

your mockups directly to Chrome so developers have a pixel-perfect visual reference to build from.\n\n** How it works **\n\n1. When you're ready to share your mockups, use the plugin to create a new screen. You can add mobile, tablet and desktop sizes and notify the developer via email that things are good to go.\n\n2. The developer uses the Chrome plugin to overlay the mockups directly in the browser window as they build.

Also I couldnt use Figma's Tidy Up feature as it doesnt allow me to specify columns or rows - plus when you delete or move an item the flow is broken.\n\nDid you run into any issues or do you want to

Use the Figma plugin to quickly include translated content in your designs without going back and forth with product managers, translators and developers. \n\nThis Figma plugin allows you to:\n\n- Push texts from Figma to Lokalise\n- Set key names (unique identifiers that are used for representing text in code and your design) or use any of the patterns for automatic naming \n- Match Figma texts to existing Lokalise keys (and existing translations)\n- Pull translated texts from Lokalise to Figma\n- Seamlessly switch languages in Figma and check if your design works in other languages\n \nLaunch the plugin\n\n1. Open your Figma project\n2. Go to the Plugins section and choose Lokalise\n3. Connect your Lokalise account\n4. Allow Figma to access your Lokalise workspace.\n5. Go back to Figma and select one of the existing Lokalise projects or create a new one. You can also set the default key naming pattern and the default platform for the newly created keys (this applies to the keys this Figma plugin will create in Lokalise).\n6. Click Finish Setup.\n\nWhen the setup is complete. Start using the plugin by pushing your Figma strings to the Lokalise project so translators can start working on them right away. \n\nFor more information (with screenshots) check out the detailed documentation page\nhttps://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3732824-figma\n\nThis plugin requires a paid Lokalise account (14-day free trial).","version":"11","icon_path":"plugins/818840482503404814/4027/c390daf7-8ef0-4bd8-b601-979084ca7f94-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/818840482503404814/4027/c390daf7-8ef0-4bd8-b601-979084ca7f94-cover","code_path":"plugins/818840482503404814/7905/3f4f35a2-6d36-4151-ad99-8969ee1cd475-code","resource_staging_signature":"3f4f35a2-6d36-4151-ad99-8969ee1cd475","manifest":{"id":"818840482503404814","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Lokalise"},"release_notes":"1.3.0 Changelog:\n- Added text formatting support\n- Improved performance with large proojects\n- “Link new duplicate to a single key” ffixed to work coorrectly\n- Some edge case handling","created_at":"2020-08-13T11:00:54.094Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/818840482503404814/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/818840482503404814/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/818840482503404814/code"}},"creator":{"id":"816302260934550677","handle":"Edmund Beinarovic","img_url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0919e8023ce1cdd321abf8276bec4fff?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_e_v2.png"},"author_org":null,"author_team":{"id":"861941885926870892","name":"Lokalise"},"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"819711000718921105","created_at":"2020-03-11T23:18:52.064Z","current_plugin_version_id":"6707","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"alexdrugov@gmail.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-03-23T17:44:55.101Z","install_count":1129,"like_count":40,"view_count":28206,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"275956","realtime_token":"/plugin-819711000718921105:1598180361:0:bedd8600f6f2d5f0d5bbd1f347d4d648143dd281","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/819711000718921105/thumbnail","tags":["grid","group","layout","mansory","masonry","organize","random","randomize"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"275956","user_id":"512709209060812887","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":null,"profile_handle":"yutani","public_at":"2019-10-23T14:54:54.106Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":0,"name":"Alexandr Drugov","img_url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0abcb5b9a32e3e0939bdcb0ed4807eb?size=240&default=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-alpha.figma.com%2Fstatic%2Fuser_a_v2.png","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"806","plugin_id":"819711000718921105","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"6707":{"id":"6707","plugin_id":"819711000718921105","name":"Masonry Grid Layout Organizer","description":"Masonry Grid now in Figma.

Variables","description":"A plugin that helps customize Figma components in an orderly and automatic manner.\n\nCreate and edit preset variables within your component without the hassle of going through groups and autolayouts.\n\n__________________\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n• TEXT VARIABLES\nAssign a variable name to a text layer and change the text content through the panel.\n\nName the text layer wrapping it in curly brackets. The name inside will be assigned to the variable. \n\nE.g.: {label} will create a variable `label`.\n\n• SELECTOR VARIABLES\nCreate grouped options which only one is shown at a time.\n\nWrap the layer name in brackets, the first name should be the group name and the second the variable name. Separate the names with a '.' .\n\nWhen selected, all layers will be hidden, expect the chosen one.\n\nE.g.: [Color.Blue], [Color.Green] creates a group 'Color' in which you can choose between 'Blue' and 'Green' colors.\n\n• CONDITION VARIABLES\nShow or hide a layer based on a condition.\n\nName the layer wrapping it in parenthesis.

Run Pitchdeck inside the page containing your frames.\n5. Apply animations, embed URLs, links or notes to each slide.\n6. Click the \"Export Presentation\" button.\n7. Select format/options and click \"Export\" or \"Upload\".\n8. Enjoy your presentation!\n\nFor step-by-step video tutorials: \n• Create and present an animated deck - https://youtu.be/CgHfcrm3oXw\n• Embed GIF/YouTube/Vimeo URLs - https://youtu.be/sT8Rt1DLnCM\n• Add clickable URL links -https://youtu.be/vyqGdJy8Hdw\n• Export for PowerPoint - https://youtu.be/IkiG4PWJZEM\n• Export for Keynote - https://youtu.be/yJ3W1pjS0LI\n• Export for Google Slides - https://youtu.be/BkMRUL5SvmE\n• Export to PDF - https://youtu.be/W_W8aYQvg28\n\n— Additional Notes\n\n• Due to GIF export not being natively supported in Figma, any GIFs added \"directly\" inside your Figma designs won't be animated; to use animated GIFs, please add them as URLs inside the Pitchdeck plugin.\n\n• 16:9 ratio frames are recommended (eg. 1280x720 or 1920x1080) for the best presentation results across most monitors and TV screens.\n\n• If your presentation contains many frames with large images, please note that Pitchdeck may take a bit longer to initially load (and refresh) your frames. Please ensure your page only includes frames you want to include in your presentation to avoid excessive load times.\n\n• You can set a solid background colour on any slide by setting the \"fill\" of that frame to the colour you'd like in Figma. If you'd like to use a gradient background, please use a rectangle background layer to do this.\n\n• Editable text layers for PowerPoint/Keynote/Google Slides exports is currently in BETA; there may be some inconsistencies with the formatting in your design. You can enable it by toggling \"Use Editable Text\" in the export settings.\n\n• If you add or update any layers in your Figma file while Pitchdeck is already running, you can click the \"Refresh\" icon in the Pitchdeck header menu to refresh your layers and make them show up in the Pitchdeck slides and animation previews.\n\n• Pitchdeck will automatically detect if a layer contains areas of full transparency and set \"PNG\" as the default export format, otherwise it will be set to \"JPG\". You can override this to set the export format of any layer to JPG or PNG by adding your own export setting.\n\n• Safari has compatibility issues with the PDF export option; to use this option, please run Pitchdeck in another browser (like Chrome or Firefox) or the Figma desktop app.\n\n• Presentation URLs will automatically expire after a 30 day period of inactivity (30 days after the link was last accessed and viewed); if you would like to re-activate the URL after it has expired, simply run Pitchdeck in the Figma file and click \"Upload Web Presentation\".\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried exporting presentations with Pitchdeck 10 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key. Your license key will allow you or your team to animate and export an unlimited amount of presentations using Pitchdeck.\n\nTo purchase a license or to find out more, please visit

Smartling’s localization plugin for Figma seamlessly connects your designers with Smartling’s translation service in just one click.\n\nYou prototype user experiences in English because that’s the primary language of your product or digital environment.

This is the design you'll create alternate versions of.\n\n3. Add the layers, content, or keywords in the appropriately labeled red-tabbed cells. \n\n4. Add the \"Override\" information in those red tabs. When you \"Sync\" the sheet, FigSheets will look for the layer names or keywords to create new versions of your Master.\n\n5. Hit \"Sync!\" Alternate versions should appear like magic.\n\nTip: If you want to generate Components, just make your Master Template a Component or Instance.

Supports text, images, and colors. \n\nHow to use:\n\n1. Create a public Google Sheet. The headings for each column in your sheet is then used to tag layers in Figma.\n2. Run the Data Roulette plugin. Create a new data set and paste yuor public sheet url in\n3. Tag layers in Figma with column titles prefixed with '#'\n4. Select layers and click \"Insert Data\" to get random data inserted based on the tags in your selection\n\nTags\n- Tag layers with using '#' followed by the column title. Example: #Description for a column titled 'Description' in Google Sheets\n- Tags can contain spaces. Example: #User Name\n\nData Sets\n- Create multiple Data Sets to separate and organize data from multiple spreadsheets\n\nCombine Tags\n- Combine tags using '+'. Example: #First Name + #Last Name\n- You can insert a text value and color the text using this method. Example: #Comment + #Comment Color\n\nImages\n- Add urls to images (must be https) in your sheet. Tagging shape layers with image url data will apply the linked images as fills.\n- Supports base64 data urls (e.g. data:image/png;base64...)\n\nColors\n- Add colors as Hex, RGB, or RGBA values in your sheet. Tagging a shape or text layer will apply colors as a fills.\n\nGrouping\nData is grouped by row, so for instance if you have 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' columns, filling data into tagged layers will pair the appropriate values for that user entry. If you want to separate data use another data set, or create multiple sheets within a single Google Sheet for each tyoe of related data.","version":"1","icon_path":"plugins/802301551610616662/4977/7d0d6e46-6f4b-4d6b-bd06-44a8261c9386-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/802301551610616662/4977/7d0d6e46-6f4b-4d6b-bd06-44a8261c9386-cover","code_path":"plugins/802301551610616662/4977/7d0d6e46-6f4b-4d6b-bd06-44a8261c9386-code","resource_staging_signature":"7d0d6e46-6f4b-4d6b-bd06-44a8261c9386","manifest":{"id":"802301551610616662","ui":"dist/ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"dist/code.js","name":"Data Roulette"},"release_notes":"","created_at":"2020-04-13T10:41:02.672Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/802301551610616662/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/802301551610616662/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/802301551610616662/code"}},"creator":{"id":"800856543318155868","handle":"Hamish","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/95b969a9-a360-414b-9303-6518ccda006d"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"829960894114212812","created_at":"2020-04-09T06:08:17.084Z","current_plugin_version_id":"4895","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"peterwang1996@outlook.com","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-04-17T23:04:18.004Z","install_count":383,"like_count":16,"view_count":26496,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"790","realtime_token":"/plugin-829960894114212812:1598180361:0:d4dc2707dfee21bf9afa1a73796db1dcdb042cf7","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/829960894114212812/thumbnail","tags":["export","tag"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"790","user_id":"666260172700640730","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":null,"profile_handle":"790","public_at":"2020-05-09T10:18:11.800Z","follower_count":1,"following_count":0,"name":"王魏东（Peter Wang）","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/b2ad5692-7383-4e65-8136-811d01c4749e","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"903","plugin_id":"829960894114212812","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"4895":{"id":"4895","plugin_id":"829960894114212812","name":"Frames Tag","description":"Export the whole page as a large image, with tags on each frame","version":"2","icon_path":"plugins/829960894114212812/4893/cd603415-f548-4756-aa94-905c509f9d50-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/829960894114212812/4895/56d5d7b6-557c-4127-ad77-8cb4e4ab3883-cover","code_path":"plugins/829960894114212812/4895/56d5d7b6-557c-4127-ad77-8cb4e4ab3883-code","resource_staging_signature":"56d5d7b6-557c-4127-ad77-8cb4e4ab3883","manifest":{"id":"829960894114212812","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Frames Tag"},"release_notes":"Fixed a typo on cover art","created_at":"2020-04-09T07:11:24.229Z","redirect_icon_url":"/community/plugin/829960894114212812/icon","redirect_cover_image_url":"/community/plugin/829960894114212812/thumbnail","redirect_code_url":"/community/plugin/829960894114212812/code"}},"creator":{"id":"666260172700640730","handle":"王魏东（Peter Wang）","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/e51c7fe5-30a0-4ece-b4bc-dc31407e77af"},"author_org":null,"author_team":null,"current_user_liked":null},{"id":"831003768229656707","created_at":"2020-04-12T03:12:17.650Z","current_plugin_version_id":"5235","unpublished_at":null,"support_contact":"https://github.com/thomas-lowry/layout-grid-visualizer","approval_status":null,"approved_at":"2020-04-17T23:06:43.538Z","install_count":1881,"like_count":77,"view_count":92461,"blocked_at":null,"profile_id":"35","realtime_token":"/plugin-831003768229656707:1598180361:0:a63d4fe9e554aea7c306f59c6ea176e14152dac7","redirect_thumbnail_url":"/community/plugin/831003768229656707/thumbnail","tags":["documentation","grid","grids","gridsystems","layout","layoutgrids"],"install_status":null,"publisher":{"id":"35","user_id":"389280060724156709","team_id":null,"org_id":null,"location":"Toronto, Canada","profile_handle":"tom","public_at":"2019-09-25T21:36:48.753Z","follower_count":252,"following_count":6,"name":"Tom Lowry","img_url":"https://s3-alpha.figma.com/profile/d08eaecc-cbd2-4ea9-b419-b6020e4ac31d","current_user_is_following":null},"roles":{"id":"922","plugin_id":"831003768229656707","org_id":null,"team_id":null,"is_public":true,"org":null},"versions":{"5235":{"id":"5235","plugin_id":"831003768229656707","name":"Layout Grid Visualizer","description":"Generate layers from your layout grids so you can export images or prepare diagrams to supplement your design systems documentation.\n\n1.

Push updates from either direction, and never again copy and paste names manually to identify things on your canvas.\n\n⠀\nHow to use\n—————\n⒈ Select one or multiple layers\n⒉ Go to the plugin menu and select Label Maker ▸ From Layer Name\n\nThat's it! One label for each selected layer is now created. The menu commands are used for both creating and updating labels, and layers can only have one label in the document at a time. \n\n⠀\nWhat you can do\n——————––––\n• Push and pull the latest names using sidebar shortcuts or the Figma menu\n• Find the layer linked to the current selection, even across different pages\n• Click on any label and restore its master component to edit label styles across your file\n• Leverage Figma's quick switch between text objects to rename several labels in a row, then propagate all changes to the layers' names\n\n⠀\nFAQ\n——\n• I don't see sidebar shortcuts on my layer!\nThat could be either because you didn't run the plugin from the menu on that layer at least once, or because you're using an instance of a component. Figma doesn't support registering sidebar shortcuts in instances yet, but the plugin still works from the menu.\n\n• Can I run it via a keyboard shortcut?\nFor many workflows, relying on Figma's native ⌘＋⌥＋P (Run Last Plugin) should speed things up enough. The plugin's commands don't distinguish between creation and update exactly so that the only shortcut we have is as smart as it can be.

Compare instances to their default main component and copy and paste the overrides.\n\nFeatures\n1. Copy and paste overrides between symbols\n\nTwo of Figma's greatest strengths are:\n\na. Overriding colors, text, and other properties on component instances, and \nb. Swapping out instances of components, such as a icons or states.\n\nBut when you swap an instance, you lose all the overrides you've made, including changes to nested instances within a parent component.\n\nMaximum Override allows you to copy your overrides, swap out an instance, and then paste the overrides back onto the new instance, to retain all of your changes. This includes nested instances that you've swapped with a different component.\n\n2. Compare properties between objects\n\nMaximum Override also allows you to select any two nodes on the stage and compare them against each other to see what's different.

Easily send your design texts from Figma to Transifex’s powerful translation management system (TMS) to get them translated. Pull the translated texts back to Figma to validate internationalization (i18n) and resolve any translation issues before coding begins. \n\nLet your designers preview the localized designs and make all necessary adjustments right away, to avoid costly delays in refactoring localization bugs and give your localization users a great UX. Give your translators rich context with screenshots to let them understand where and how the translation will appear so that they deliver higher quality translations. \n\nBoost collaboration between your designers and translators. Deliver new digital experiences faster. \n\nUsing with Transifex\nConnecting Figma with Transifex\n\n1. Make sure that you have access to at least one organization and one project in Transifex.\n2. Install the “Transifex Figma Plugin” in your Figma app.\n3. Open your Figma file. \n4. Go to plugins and select “Transifex Figma Plugin”.\n6. Add your Transifex credentials in the “Settings” tab: First you need to connect with Transifex using an API token. Generate this token from your Transifex account under User Settings => API token. After generating the token, copy and paste it in the related input box in the Figma plugin and click “Connect”.\n\nYou should complete the following plugin settings after connecting with Transifex:\nOrganization: the desired organization to work with.\nProject: the desired project that these Figma strings will be associated with.\nResource: the desired resource of the selected project to push strings to. If you don’t have any resources you can try to create one using the action “Create a new resource” (note that you should have the adequate permissions in order to perform this action).\n\nAfter setting the options, click “Save”.\n\nUsing the plugin\n\n1. Start selecting the Figma layers that you want to send, or “push”, to your Transifex resource for translation.\n2. Your selection will collect your text layers as strings in the main window of the plugin, under both the “Push strings to Transifex” and “Pull strings from Transifex” tabs.\n3. To remove any unwanted strings from the selection in the “Push” or “Pull” tabs, click the X to the right of the string. That string will be removed from the current selection list.\n4. Click the “Push” button to send the selected strings to Transifex and add them to the connected resource. After pushing the strings you can check to see that they were successfully sent using the “View resource in Transifex” link. Also you have the option to upload screenshots if you have selected “Upload Screenshots”. The strings will be translated according to the workflow set up in the Transifex project.\n5. By default the plugin will automatically generate screenshots of your Figma frames and include them with the pushed strings in Transifex. The strings for translation will be automatically mapped to the screenshots in Transifex to provide visual context of your Figma designs to your translators and ensure the quality of the translation. Optionally you can disable screenshot generation for any string push by deselecting the “Upload Screenshots” checkbox in the “Push Strings to Transifex” tab.\n6. You can use the “Replace Resource Strings” feature to clean extra or outdated strings out of your Transifex resources. if this option is checked when you click the “Push” button to send strings to Transifex, then all of the strings currently in the connected resource will be purged and replaced with the current selection only. This option should be used carefully, especially with resources shared by other users. If you are sure you want to replace all the strings in the resource with the current selection, click “OK” in the confirmation dialog. The resource strings will be replaced, and the “Replace” option will be reset to deactivated. All of your previous translations remain in the translation memory (TM) so you and your team can reuse them, unless they are also deleted from the TM in Transifex.\n7. To pull translations back from Transifex to Figma, first select the Figma layers you want to get translations for and then click the “Pull” button in the “Pull Strings from Transifex” tab. You have the option to pull them in all languages or in a specific one by selecting it in the “Language” dropdown. The pull operation will create a new page in your Figma file for every language with the same name of the selected page and the language code as prefix, and automatically insert translations for the selected strings.\n\nAbout Transifex\nFounded in Greece and now headquartered in Silicon Valley, Transifex helps companies - from Startups to the Enterprise - go global.

Learn more at https://www.plasmic.app.\n\nThe importer fully automates the low-level details of converting Figma’s document representation to standard DOM representations. A few highlights:\n\n- Supports constraints and auto-layout.\n- Translates blend modes.\n- Adapts border styles including centered borders.\n- Handles filter effects like background blur and layer blur.\n- Preserves affine transformations like scales and rotations.\n- Handles all fill types including linear and radial gradients and images.\n- Imports vector and compound shapes as SVGs.\n- Mirrors the original hierarchical structure.\n- Carries over most type styles.\n\nOnce in Plasmic, the design could immediately be published as a standalone static website in CodeSandbox or your own codebase. But you will often also want to refactor the design into a more hygienic and lasting structure, suitable for production and for integrating with code. That’s where the rest of Plasmic’s toolset comes in, letting you take advantage of the richer layout, component structure (variants/slots), interactions, style abstractions (mixins/tokens), and element types (such as form elements) for functionality and accessibility.

Layer from Instances","description":"Iterations always demand new additions to components. All of us have encountered cases where we need to add something to a component but don’t want that to show up in all the hundreds and thousands of existing instances. We finally end up creating a new component so that the existing work is not affected. This plugin solves this issue with a single click.\n\nFollow these steps to hide a particular layer from all component instances\n• Select the layer/group/frame that you want to hide from one of the instances of a component\n• Select Hide Layers from Instances -> Hide\n• The selected layer/group/frame will be hidden from all instances in the current page\n\nUse the Force Hide option if the layer that you want to hide is part of a component that is nested in multiple other components and you want to hide the layer in all of them at once.\nEg.: If you want to hide a layer in an icon component that is already used in various other components like different state and sizes of buttons, then Hide option will just hide the layer in the selected state or size of the button. Whereas Force Hide will hide the layer in all the instances of all the components that this icon is used.\n\nThis plugin works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide option. ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique. If not, multiple layers may get hidden.\n\nFeels too small a feature for a plugin? There is also a Scripter File for this that you can use. https://www.figma.com/community/file/858014268242545394/Hide-Layers-from-Instances\n\nDo let us know if you want any additional features.

Thus, font types and style names are the best way to get to a text node. This plugin makes that possible.\n\nIn our beta testing, designers who use this plugin use it so often and after a while can’t imagine their workflow without it.

Screens get imported as images so they are not directly editable. This allows you to keep your source files organized and create global flows to present to PMs, POs, Stakeholders, etc. Screens keep connected by their Artboard name so you can update them whenever you need if there are any changes to the source files.\n\n2. If creating device mockups you can mirror your screens to import images from your screens quickly without manually copy pasting them.\n\n-- How to use --\n\n1. Create a new file where you want to import all of your files.\n2. Generate an access token from your Settings page under your profile name.\n3. Copy the generated token.\n4. Open the Connect plugin and paste your token.\n5. You can now paste any file link you want to import.\n6. Select the screens you want to import. You can search through them, or filter by pages.\n7. Hit 'Mirror Selected' and that's it!\n\nYou can now use arrow plugins to connect your screens if you need to create a flow. If you make any changes to the original screens just import your file again and select the screens you want to overwrite.

accordingly.","version":"3","icon_path":"plugins/874515048823651494/7703/796bd3c7-a1bc-4763-82b7-f5be8d06a916-icon","cover_image_path":"plugins/874515048823651494/8090/ffa1e0a8-2584-481d-8560-c4be757e8e86-cover","code_path":"plugins/874515048823651494/8193/9f1279c7-5192-4d75-92b8-5b05fca4c6e9-code","resource_staging_signature":"9f1279c7-5192-4d75-92b8-5b05fca4c6e9","manifest":{"id":"874515048823651494","ui":"ui.html","api":"1.0.0","main":"code.js","name":"Connect

no other websites, apps or APIs required.\n• Converts each artboard (layer-by-layer) to a real .sketch or .xd file.\n• Simple pages converted in seconds; larger pages in minutes.\n• Converts almost all layer styles and properties (see below for details).\n• Retains all your Figma export settings for every layer.\n• Keeps your layer's visiblility/locked/expanded (etc) states.\n• Download the exported .sketch or .xd file to your computer from Figma.\n\n— To use Convertify\n\n1. Install Convertify and run the plugin in your Figma file.\n2. Switch to the page you would like to convert.\n3. Click on your desired \"Convert\" button.\n4. Wait for the conversion process to finish.\n5. Download and enjoy your .sketch or .xd file!\n\nFor step-by-step video tutorials: \n• Convert Figma to Sketch - https://youtu.be/1zwE3xSJeas\n• Convert Figma to Adobe XD - https://youtu.be/cGYU2jvnSs8\n\n— Not Supported Yet\n\n• Auto/smart layout properties\n• Components -> Symbols\n• Local/shared styles\n• Prototype links\n\n— Sketch/XD Missing Features\n\n• Hiding parent artboards (in Sketch/XD)\n• Rotated parent artboards (in Sketch/XD)\n• Ellipsis with \"arc\" properties (in Sketch/XD)\n• Mulitple fills/strokes on a layer (in XD)\n• Vector layers that use corner radius (in XD)\n• Strokes/fills applied to groups (in XD)\n• Vertical alignment for text layers (in XD)\n• Nested layer masks (in XD)\n\n— Additional Notes\n\n• There are some cases were you may need to click the \"Missing Fonts\" notification in Sketch and manually re-assign them if they're not currently installed on your computer.\n\n• Groups in Sketch can't have backgrounds, so Convertify will add a background \"rectangle\" layer to visually emulate group backgrounds from your Figma design.\n\n• Non-destructive image cropping isn't supported in Sketch, so Convertify will transform your cropped images from Figma to a \"masked\" Sketch group, retaining your full original image and emulating its visual crop.\n\n• \"Clip content\" doesn't exist on group layers in Sketch, so Convertify will create a \"mask\" layer at the bottom of the group to visually emulate clipping for Figma frames with clipped content enabled.\n\n• Vertically aligned text isn't supported in Adobe XD, so Convertify will attempt to emulate vertically aligned text (where possible) by offsetting the top position.\n\n— Bug Reports\n\nConvertify is pretty new (like a baby panda); so if you do notice an obvious bug, please get in touch and we'll try to publish a fix for it!\n\n— License\n\nAfter you've tried exporting your Figma designs with Convertify 10 times, you'll be asked to enter your license key.
